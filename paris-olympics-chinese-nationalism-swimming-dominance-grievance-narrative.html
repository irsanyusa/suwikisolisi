It’s a stage for great power rivalry—with every Chinese success serving as evidence of faltering Western dominance.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“White superiority has collapsed!” reads a popular <a href=#>post</a> on Weibo, after swimmer Pan Zhanle won gold in the men’s 100-m freestyle—breaking the world record he had previously set—and Zheng Qinwen became the first Chinese player to win gold in an Olympic tennis singles event.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Pan and Zheng have “jointly dug the grave for white supremacy,” the post declared, noting that swimming and tennis are typically the fortes of Europeans and Americans.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The 100-m freestyle is like the crown jewel of swimming,” <a href=#>wrote</a> another Weibo user. “The world record has been broken by a yellow-skinned person, so they [Americans] are really stung by it.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And when the Chinese swimming team broke the U.S.’s 64-year reign over the men’s 4x100-m medley relay on Sunday, nationalists saw it as further confirmation of the end of U.S. domination across society.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Pan Zhanle came out of nowhere, like Usain Bolt in the swimming pool, and slapped Europeans and Americans in the face again and again,” reads one of the top <a href=#>posts</a> on Weibo celebrating the team’s relay victory. “How lucky that our generation can witness our country and ethnicity breaking the Western monopoly in various fields: economy, industry, technology, and sports.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In keeping with a longstanding ethno-nationalist <a href=#>state narrative</a> that frames China as a historical victim of an imperialist West due for its comeuppance, much of the Chinese public opinion expressed about the country’s victories in Paris so far seems to focus on the foreign losers as much as the Chinese winners—with an emphasis on triumph over those who have aggrieved China, particularly the U.S.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At the Paris Olympics, several incidents involving Chinese athletes—like tennis champion Zheng being <a href=#>criticized by rival Emma Navarro</a>, a photographer <a href=#>accidentally breaking</a> table tennis player Wang Chuqin’s paddle, and another who had apparently <a href=#>shoved Wang</a>—have all gone viral among Chinese social media users who are interpreting these as attempts to disrespect or sabotage China.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This perceived dynamic has been most prominent in swimming events, where Chinese athletes have complained of being unfairly maligned by allegations related to a <a href=#>doping scandal</a> and being snubbed by unfriendly peers in Paris.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Pan described his historic 100-m freestyle win as “avenging an insult,” claiming that Australia’s silver medalist Kyle Chalmers had blatantly ignored him when he tried to say hi before the race (Chalmers <a href=#>denied</a> doing so and later said they’d <a href=#>patched things up</a>) and that the U.S. team had splashed water at the Chinese coach (observers have called the accusation “<a href=#>dubious</a>”). “It felt like they were looking down on us,” Pan said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">His words <a href=#>went</a> <a href=#>viral</a> and were met with a wave of support on Chinese social media. “It’s a world record set under their indignant gaze!” <a href=#>wrote</a> a Weibo user. “Pan Zhanle used his action to give them a tight slap!”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Faced with skepticism from the outside, as well as foreign athletes’ disrespect and arrogance, Pan Zhanle responded by breaking the world record in the final,” Chinese news outlet The Paper <a href=#>posted on Weibo</a>.</p><p

silver medal] and American [Alex] swimmers.👇<a href=#>pic.twitter.com/LCBUY8ISxH</a></p>— ShanghaiPanda (@thinking_panda) <a href=#>August 1, 2024</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As for the doping scandal, which a third of China’s Olympic swimmers <a href=#>are embroiled in</a>, the athletes have maintained their innocence, and their supporters are decrying the allegations as a smear campaign by the West.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Wang Guan, a host for the state media China Global Television Network, <a href=#>wrote on Weibo</a> that the “Western sports sphere” was trying to “kill our reputation” with media coverage of the doping scandal. “International outreach efforts also apply to sports,” he said. “We can never lose this battle.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Some athletes themselves, who have been subjected to rigorous drug testing, have also suggested that the doping allegations leveled at them are politically motivated. Breaststroke world record holder Qin Haiyang, who had tested positive for the banned heart drug trimetazidine (TMZ) before the Tokyo Olympics, <a href=#>said</a> that the tests were a plot by European and American teams to “disrupt our preparation rhythm and destroy our psychological defense.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Why are Chinese athletes questioned when they swim fast?” Chinese swimmer Zhang Yufei, who had also tested positive for TMZ in 2020, <a href=#>asked</a> at a press briefing last week, after winning the bronze medal in the women’s 200-m butterfly. “Previously, when the great [Michael] Phelps won seven, eight gold medals, why didn’t anyone dare to question him?” (Phelps had, in fact, been subject to doping allegations during his career, including by <a href=#>his</a> <a href=#>rivals</a>.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Zhang’s comments were reshared by state-run newspaper Global Times, which lambasted the “double standards” held by Westerners.&nbsp;</p><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#Comment</a>: The logic of some Westerners is ridiculous: The West can, but China can’t. This kind of double standards has no Olympic spirit at all, and has only exposed their arrogance, prejudice and discrimination to the world. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/QlwD5WKlg2</a></p>— Global Times (@globaltimesnews) <a href=#>August 4, 2024</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Chinese social media users’ general sense of grievance has even morphed into conspiracy theories that it’s the <a href=#>U.S. swimmers who are actually doping</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">China, which has <a href=#>invested heavily</a> in athletic development, has already enjoyed decades of Olympic success, consistently ranking among the countries with the most gold medals (alongside the U.S. and the U.K.). But even as Chinese athletes in Paris have made further strides in sports traditionally dominated by Westerners, a sense of the injustice and isolation they’ve been forced to overcome continues to loom over Olympic discourse.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Some Western media have always been trying to depict China as a rigid authoritarian country with no freedom and fun, and that Chinese people are not cool at all,” reads an <a href=#>article</a> published this week in the Global Times, “but Chinese Gen-Z athletes tell the opposite story in Paris, breaking bias and lies circulating in the West.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZwaGBufXd9jqmYq6GjYrytxcypoJyrXZi1qrrErJxmppGptrC6wKWgrKVdqMSqucyipaBllKS6qrrAp5qeZZentqbCwKeanmWelr%2BzrdOirZ5n</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./naked-attraction.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Naked Attraction popularity &amp;amp; fame</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./fun-ways-to-celebrate-workers-day-in-nigeria.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fun ways to celebrate workers' day in Nigeria</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2027-deputy-speaker-kalu-joins-call-for-gov-otti-to-join-apc.html>2027: Deputy Speaker, Kalu joins call for Gov Otti to join APC</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bruxelles-accorde-une-subvention-de-356-millions-deuros-aux-victimes-de-xynthia.html>Bruxelles accorde une subvention de 35,6 millions d'euros aux victimes de Xynthia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./prise-en-compte-de-la-penibilite-dans-la-fonction-publique-large-desaccord-entre-le-gouvernement-et.html>dsaccord sur les dparts anticips des fonctionnaires</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./events.html>Historical Events in April 1920</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1258549-nicole-kidman-bio-age-height-husband-children-net-worth-html.html>Nicole Kidman bio: age, height, husband, children, net worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVlog.
