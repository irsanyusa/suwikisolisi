Verne, the visionary</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dc2/0ed/551b8856f1b5064392cf000f8c.jpg><p>One of&nbsp;Jules Verne’s most recognized works, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>From the Earth to&nbsp;the Moon</i></a>, which was published in&nbsp;1865, is&nbsp;about a&nbsp;cannon called “Columbiad,” which fires a&nbsp;human-crewed projectile aimed at&nbsp;Selene. Interestingly, 104 years later, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Apollo XI</a>&nbsp;spacecraft module that completed the mission to&nbsp;the Moon was named “Columbia.”</p><p>The name <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Columbia</a> was first suggested to&nbsp;Michael Collins by&nbsp;Julian Scheer, one of&nbsp;NASA’s public affairs assistants. He&nbsp;mentioned the name offhandedly in&nbsp;a&nbsp;telephone conversation, saying, “Some of&nbsp;us up&nbsp;here have been kicking around <i>Columbia</i>.” Although the name initially seemed a&nbsp;bit “over the top” to&nbsp;Collins, he&nbsp;eventually named the module that because he&nbsp;couldn’t think of&nbsp;a&nbsp;better choice. Besides, his crewmates Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong had no&nbsp;other suggestions. Then, Collins realized the similarity of&nbsp;the name to&nbsp;Columbiad, the cannon invented by&nbsp;Verne.</p><p><h2>2. A&nbsp;striking resemblance</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/81b/5cd/966b395c2ca739d1bd340f875d.jpg><p>The famous driver Enzo Anselmo Ferrari, founder of&nbsp;the Scuderia Ferrari Grand Prix racing team and later of&nbsp;the Ferrari brand, died on&nbsp;August&nbsp;14, 1988, after having devoted his entire life to&nbsp;automobiles.</p><p>Two months later, on&nbsp;October&nbsp;15, Mesut Özil was born in&nbsp;Germany. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=soccer data-link=tag>soccer</a> midfielder and could pass as&nbsp;Ferrari’s identical twin. The resemblance is&nbsp;extraordinary and, moreover, the coincidence of&nbsp;the dates is&nbsp;very <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>striking</a>.</p><p><h2>3. The history of&nbsp;the Titanic written in&nbsp;a&nbsp;novel</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5dc/9f2/0057565f559cffc908bdd6e650.jpg><p>The sinking of&nbsp;the <a href=# title=Titanic data-link=tag>Titanic</a> was a&nbsp;historical event that shocked humankind. It&nbsp;was impossible to&nbsp;predict or&nbsp;even imagine, since it&nbsp;had been advertised as&nbsp;unsinkable.</p><p>However, several years earlier, in&nbsp;1898, the writer Morgan Robertson published a&nbsp;novel called <i>Futility</i>. It&nbsp;narrated the shipwreck that occurred after the sinking of&nbsp;an&nbsp;ocean liner called “Titan,” which collided with an&nbsp;iceberg. The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>similarities</a> were striking.</p><p><h2>4. The Händel-Hendrix coincidence</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c28/b47/61e22f5599bde3eaa4c37830a4.jpg><p>The composer Georg Friedrich Händel, one of&nbsp;the <a href=# title=musical data-link=tag>musical</a> geniuses of&nbsp;the 17th and 18th centuries, lived at&nbsp;number 25&nbsp;Brook Street in&nbsp;London’s Mayfair district. In&nbsp;that same street, at&nbsp;number&nbsp;23, lived another musical genius of&nbsp;the 20th century, Jimi Hendrix.</p><p>One lived there until 1759; the other in&nbsp;the late 1960s. Besides this, the sound of&nbsp;their surnames is&nbsp;very similar. Today the house is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>museum</a>.</p><p><h2>5. Anthony Hopkins’ long-lost book</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/481/930/5ab72759fc98ac76d1bcf0d252.jpg><p>Before becoming a&nbsp;major Hollywood actor, <a href=# title="Anthony Hopkins" data-link=tag>Anthony Hopkins</a> was offered a&nbsp;role in&nbsp;<i>The Girl from Petrovka</i>. Committed to&nbsp;his work, he&nbsp;searched for a&nbsp;copy of&nbsp;the original novel, written by&nbsp;George Feifer, so&nbsp;that he&nbsp;could play the character more faithfully. To&nbsp;the actor’s surprise, he&nbsp;could not find a&nbsp;copy of&nbsp;the book anywhere.</p><p>However, on&nbsp;one occasion, while walking in&nbsp;London, he&nbsp;saw an&nbsp;abandoned book on&nbsp;a&nbsp;park bench, and, of&nbsp;all the books lost in&nbsp;the world, it&nbsp;was precisely <i>The Girl from Petrovka</i>. But the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>anecdote</a> does not end there because the actor met George Feifer himself during the filming. The writer commented that he&nbsp;did not have a&nbsp;copy of&nbsp;his own book, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;had once lent it&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;friend who had lost it&nbsp;in&nbsp;London. So&nbsp;Hopkins took out his copy and showed it&nbsp;to&nbsp;him: of&nbsp;course, it&nbsp;was the same one.</p><p><h2>6. Twins reunited</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1fb/888/ddff1d5396ae5717baa68e33e2.jpg><p>In&nbsp;1979, 39-year-old twins were reunited after being separated at&nbsp;3&nbsp;weeks of&nbsp;age. But their <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reunion</a> was full of&nbsp;surprises: both were named Jim (names given to&nbsp;them by&nbsp;their foster parents), both loved math and carpentry, and both worked in&nbsp;security.</p><p>But even more curious was that their first wives were both named Linda. They had divorced and remarried women named Betty. Their sons were named James Allan and James Alan.</p><p><h2>7. The curious case of&nbsp;Eleanor Rigby</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fbe/44c/cc160c5fdeb6c39ca3e7ab429d.jpg><p>John Lennon and Paul McCartney met at&nbsp;St. Peter’s Church in&nbsp;Woolton in&nbsp;1957. This friendship changed the history of&nbsp;music, as&nbsp;they would later form The Beatles. Surprisingly, in&nbsp;the same place where they met, a&nbsp;few meters away, was the grave of&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman named <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Eleanor Rigby</a>.</p><p>It&nbsp;was 9&nbsp;years later when Paul McCartney wrote “Eleanor Rigby.” According to&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>data</a>, the musician named his character after the actress Eleanor Bron and a&nbsp;Bristol store called Rigby &&nbsp;Evens Ltd. He&nbsp;later said that perhaps the grave had something to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with the name of&nbsp;his song, although not directly.</p><p><h2>8. Stephen Hawking and numbers</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/db5/a1c/09cedd59daab5c6bdef12b72d7.jpg><p>ASSOCIATED PRESS / East News</p><p>We&nbsp;know that time is&nbsp;relative and that coincidences exist, and Stephen Hawking’s death comes to&nbsp;prove that. It&nbsp;occurred on&nbsp;March&nbsp;14, which is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>very significant day</a> because it&nbsp;coincides with Einstein’s 139th birthday and the day on&nbsp;which&nbsp;Pi is&nbsp;celebrated.</p><p><h2>9. The fate of&nbsp;a&nbsp;stewardess</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9c7/e8a/0359bc57deb2c51e4d457a1dc6.jpg><p>Some people are lucky in&nbsp;the most mysterious ways. Young nurse <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Violet Jessop</a> began working as&nbsp;a&nbsp;stewardess on&nbsp;the Olympic when it&nbsp;collided with another ship. Fortunately, there were no&nbsp;fatalities at&nbsp;the time and, despite the damage, the ship was able to&nbsp;return to&nbsp;port without sinking.</p><p>But a&nbsp;year later, Jessop was transferred to&nbsp;the Titanic, which struck an&nbsp;iceberg in&nbsp;1912. She survived by&nbsp;boarding lifeboat 16&nbsp;and was asked to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;a&nbsp;baby. But life put her to&nbsp;another test when she boarded the Britannic and there was an&nbsp;unexpected explosion, and she survived again. In&nbsp;fact, she died at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;83&nbsp;from heart disease.</p><p><h2>10. Mark Twain’s birthday</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/020/551/b64cd05fc29248aaf77aadcfd2.jpg><p>Every 76&nbsp;years, Halley’s comet passes by&nbsp;the Earth and can be&nbsp;seen in&nbsp;the sky. In&nbsp;1835, one of&nbsp;the years in&nbsp;which this phenomenon occurred, Mark Twain was born. Moreover, the writer <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>predicted</a> that his death would occur in&nbsp;the same year when the comet passed by&nbsp;again.</p><p>“The Almighty has said, no&nbsp;doubt, ’Now here are these two unaccountable freaks; they came in&nbsp;together, they must go&nbsp;out together,’” he&nbsp;said. Most surprisingly, he&nbsp;was not wrong, he&nbsp;died a&nbsp;day after the comet reached its closest point to&nbsp;Earth.</p><p><h2>11. The woman who was photographed twice by&nbsp;Google Maps</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e43/3a1/805c2651b69f546eec33bba5b1.jpg><p>Google Maps is&nbsp;becoming increasingly popular, and it&nbsp;predicts more and more eventualities that could occur on&nbsp;the road. And although we&nbsp;already know of&nbsp;some remarkable images that the application has given&nbsp;us, undoubtedly the one of&nbsp;Leanne Cartwright stands out.</p><p>The so-called “<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>time traveler</a>” has been captured in&nbsp;the same place, with the same pose and carrying a&nbsp;bag 10&nbsp;years apart. However, she didn’t know it&nbsp;until her husband searched for the first image and, then, found the second one.</p><p><h2>12. Mexico and its earthquakes</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d32/493/a2181f5050a4697d508c7a60af.jpg><p>Mexico is&nbsp;a&nbsp;country famous for its traditions, magic, and folklore. But in&nbsp;the last 100&nbsp;years, there have been earthquakes that go&nbsp;beyond scientific explanation. On&nbsp;September&nbsp;19, 1985, Mexico City woke up&nbsp;to&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the strongest earthquakes ever. Since then, nothing has been the same, and every year, a&nbsp;drill is&nbsp;carried out to&nbsp;avoid catastrophes.</p><p>What is&nbsp;interesting is&nbsp;that in&nbsp;2017 and 2022, a&nbsp;few minutes after conducting the drills, there <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>have been earthquakes</a>, both higher than 7&nbsp;on the Richter scale, which makes them very dangerous. Undoubtedly, September 19&nbsp;is a&nbsp;date difficult to&nbsp;forget for Mexicans.</p><p>What has happened to&nbsp;you in&nbsp;life that you think is&nbsp;more than just a&nbsp;coincidence?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5zedKtqZqml5p6pLvIp5qinJWjsKa%2FjK2fmqxdo7y1ecSvnKdlpJ2ybrnOrKtmq5uavbW1wpqjZpufqrmlecSxp6WZmaN6eX2PaW5pZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./0-28804-1624100-1624098-1623356-00-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>1991: JOANNE LAGATTA - National Spelling Bee</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./brian-cox-james-bond-reality-series-trailer-007-road-to-a-million-1235744418.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>007: Road to a Million Trailer: Brian Cox Hosts a James Bond Reality Competition With a</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2027-deputy-speaker-kalu-joins-call-for-gov-otti-to-join-apc.html>2027: Deputy Speaker, Kalu joins call for Gov Otti to join APC</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bruxelles-accorde-une-subvention-de-356-millions-deuros-aux-victimes-de-xynthia.html>Bruxelles accorde une subvention de 35,6 millions d'euros aux victimes de Xynthia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./prise-en-compte-de-la-penibilite-dans-la-fonction-publique-large-desaccord-entre-le-gouvernement-et.html>dsaccord sur les dparts anticips des fonctionnaires</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./events.html>Historical Events in April 1920</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1258549-nicole-kidman-bio-age-height-husband-children-net-worth-html.html>Nicole Kidman bio: age, height, husband, children, net worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVlog.
