How does somebody do that? I’m just trying to figure all of that out. It’s hard to understand,” the boy’s father, Dan Sanchez, told TIME. “He’s about three feet tall. He’s not a tiny 2-year-old.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s unclear how long the boy was under the beanbag chair. Police said the incident is under investigation, and there have been no arrests or charges filed. The case will also be sent to the Salt Lake District Attorney’s Office for review.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Leonardo, whose heart was donated to another child, will be buried Saturday on his birthday. Family members and friends will say goodbye to the rambunctious boy who knew how to beatbox, just learned how to say “cricket” and loved giving hugs and pretending to fish. “He just loved everything. He loved playing ball, hearing music,” said his mother, Danielle Sanchez.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Leonardo’s parents recalled feeling very confused about why their little boy was being rushed to the emergency room. “Once we learned, I kept repeating back, ‘Are you telling me a teacher sat on my kid?” the boy’s mom said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The couple’s initial feelings of confusion quickly turned into outrage. “I felt frustration. Sadness. Anger. I go through the cycle of the grieving process,” the boy’s mom said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Now they’re working to be strong for Leonardo’s three other young siblings and turn their tragedy into a positive change. Specifically, they want to fight to ban beanbag chairs from childcare facilities. “This can’t happen to anyone else. This can’t be OK,” said Dan Sanchez, 35. “The realization of it is these specific kind of chairs that we’re calling beanbags are not safe.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The West Jordan Child Center issued a statement to by <a href=# rel=noopener>Fox 13</a>, saying “We regret deeply the tragic death of a young toddler at our daycare facility.” “No words adequately describe the depth of the sorrow we feel. And, of course, we do not pretend to understand how devastating this is for the family,” the statement said. “We know the family well, we grieve with them, and we pray that God will provide them the comfort and peace they inevitably will need.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Meanwhile, little Leonardo’s toys are still strewn around the house and his parents say they still feel his presence sometimes. “Being at home is tough. I still hear him,” his father said. “We’re just trying to go one step at a time.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Part of the grieving process is to not blame each other for their son’s death—or even the daycare employee who sat on top of him. Dan Sanchez said he has forgiven the worker and accepted that the tragedy was an accident.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I’m pretty sure her heart sank down past the floor,” he said, adding that he had asked a police sergeant to check on the woman’s welfare. “I’m not upset with her. I would hate for more tragedy to happen.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“All we can do now is pray and stop something from happening to another child,” his wife added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtbGllf3SFjq2mnZycmr9ursSapWaakZx6pa3YnJirnV2owqeyzpyYrZ1f</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./green-book-movie-controversy.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What to Know About the Controversy Behind Green Book</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./contrat-dengagement-jeune-les-reserves-de-linspection-generale-des-affaires-sociales.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>les rserves de lInspection gnrale des affaires sociales</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2027-deputy-speaker-kalu-joins-call-for-gov-otti-to-join-apc.html>2027: Deputy Speaker, Kalu joins call for Gov Otti to join APC</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bruxelles-accorde-une-subvention-de-356-millions-deuros-aux-victimes-de-xynthia.html>Bruxelles accorde une subvention de 35,6 millions d'euros aux victimes de Xynthia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./prise-en-compte-de-la-penibilite-dans-la-fonction-publique-large-desaccord-entre-le-gouvernement-et.html>dsaccord sur les dparts anticips des fonctionnaires</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./events.html>Historical Events in April 1920</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1258549-nicole-kidman-bio-age-height-husband-children-net-worth-html.html>Nicole Kidman bio: age, height, husband, children, net worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVlog.
