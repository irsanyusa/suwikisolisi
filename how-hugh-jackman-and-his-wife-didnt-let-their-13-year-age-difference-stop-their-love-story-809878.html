Others are struck by&nbsp;luck and find their special someone in&nbsp;a&nbsp;seemingly orchestrated way, as&nbsp;if&nbsp;planned by&nbsp;<a href=# title=destiny data-link=tag>destiny</a>.</p><p>This happened to&nbsp;the famous actor, <a href=# title="Hugh Jackman" data-link=tag>Hugh Jackman</a>, who met the right woman one ordinary day. And, although she was born 13&nbsp;years before him, that difference in&nbsp;years could not have mattered less. This is&nbsp;their inspiring <a href=# title="love story" data-link=tag>love story</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/696/202/1f316e5049b239e832acf2a798.jpg><p>It&nbsp;was 1995, and Hugh Jackman was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>starring</a> in&nbsp;an&nbsp;ABC series, <i>Correlli</i>, his first break in&nbsp;the entertainment industry after graduating from the Western Australian Academy of&nbsp;Performing Arts. For him, this production was just the ticket to&nbsp;start his journey to&nbsp;stardom.</p><p>But the truth&nbsp;is, he&nbsp;was about to&nbsp;face the exact moment in&nbsp;which his life would change forever.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ce9/c22/7fbbdf5b72a822e045ad036555.jpg><p>It&nbsp;was on&nbsp;set that Jackman met Deborra-Lee Furness, an&nbsp;actress, director, and producer who already had 2&nbsp;decades of&nbsp;experience over him.</p><p>The actor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>remembers</a> that day like it&nbsp;was yesterday: “I&nbsp;get picked&nbsp;up, and Deb is&nbsp;in&nbsp;the front seat of&nbsp;the car. I’ll never forget. She took off her seatbelt, turned around and put out her hand and took off her sunglasses, and said, ’Hi, I’m Deborra-Lee Furness; nice to&nbsp;meet you.’ I&nbsp;remember thinking, ’I like this girl.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1ca/963/3c2a475923ac7c12612e0abc16.jpg><p>Although Jackman was very aware of&nbsp;his attraction to&nbsp;her, he&nbsp;was also unsure about asking her out or&nbsp;confessing his feelings because they were working together. That memory is&nbsp;also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>vivid</a> in&nbsp;his mind.</p><p>“Deb and&nbsp;I were already best friends, and&nbsp;I realized I’ve got a&nbsp;crush on&nbsp;my&nbsp;leading lady. This is&nbsp;the thing you do&nbsp;not&nbsp;do. It’s unprofessional and embarrassing,” he&nbsp;commented. Because of&nbsp;that, he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;stop talking to&nbsp;her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ebd/019/20326555d291879e73f03cca81.jpg><p>As&nbsp;the days passed, Jackman realized that ignoring her was not a&nbsp;good plan, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;chose to&nbsp;change his strategy. He&nbsp;invited her to&nbsp;dinner at&nbsp;his house along with 20&nbsp;other people. What happened that night was something the actor never <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expected</a>.</p><p>“She said, ’I noticed you haven’t talked to&nbsp;me&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;week; what’s going on?’ I&nbsp;said, ’I got a&nbsp;crush on&nbsp;you. I’ll get over&nbsp;it; I’m sorry.’ She goes, ’Oh? Because I’ve got a&nbsp;crush on&nbsp;you too.’ I&nbsp;never in&nbsp;a&nbsp;million years thought she reciprocated,” the actor recalled.</p><p>But she did. Turning down Mick Jagger to&nbsp;attend that dinner should’ve been enough proof!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c18/91b/38e69550769c056fbb2e1cfeaa.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the following weeks, the couple tried to&nbsp;keep their relationship a&nbsp;secret, but all their efforts were in&nbsp;vain. The chemistry between the 2&nbsp;was so&nbsp;explosive that the entire work team <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>realized</a> something was happening between them.</p><p>However, Furness had some doubts because of&nbsp;how much older than him she was, and the fact that they were both actors. She even walked <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>away</a> from him, but his charm made her reconsider. In&nbsp;the end, they stayed together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9c9/6dc/ccfe23524192dee3eea8d43935.jpg><p>4&nbsp;months into dating, Jackman had so&nbsp;little doubt about his love for Furness that he&nbsp;proposed to&nbsp;her with a&nbsp;ring he&nbsp;designed.</p><p>About this sweet gesture, the actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>remarked</a>, “He&nbsp;was very nervous because he&nbsp;had no&nbsp;idea about jewelry or&nbsp;diamonds, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;just walked in&nbsp;and said, ’I don’t know what I’m doing, so&nbsp;I’ll tell you a&nbsp;little bit about Deb.’ Poor jeweler sat there for an&nbsp;hour and a&nbsp;half, and he&nbsp;endlessly bored him, giving him every nuance of&nbsp;my&nbsp;personality.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9f6/0d8/12161a5fc68a7f1e1c1421112f.jpg><p>Within just 11&nbsp;months of&nbsp;meeting, Furness and Jackman joined their lives in&nbsp;<a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a> in&nbsp;Victoria, Australia. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Jackman</a> was also in&nbsp;charge of&nbsp;designing the rings they would exchange in&nbsp;the ceremony. Each bears an&nbsp;inscription in&nbsp;Sanskrit, “Om&nbsp;paramar mainamar,” which means “We&nbsp;dedicate our union to&nbsp;a&nbsp;greater source.”</p><p>With a&nbsp;story like this, we&nbsp;might think that their life would only be&nbsp;full of&nbsp;happy moments. However, this wasn’t the case.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/780/3f6/1e0698542ab97d585bd7cde8e2.jpg><p>When they married, Furness was in&nbsp;her forties, so&nbsp;the couple began trying to&nbsp;conceive almost immediately. Their attempts always failed, as&nbsp;the actress lost several natural and in&nbsp;vitro fertilization pregnancies.</p><p>Jackman opened his heart, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sharing</a>, “We&nbsp;tried, and it&nbsp;was not happening for&nbsp;us, and it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;difficult time. I’ll never forget&nbsp;it, the miscarriage... It’s a&nbsp;good thing to&nbsp;talk about&nbsp;it. It’s more common, and it&nbsp;is&nbsp;tough. There’s a&nbsp;grieving that you have to&nbsp;go&nbsp;through.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/16e/054/53b0c85b968c692c7497525061.jpg><p>After multiple attempts and no&nbsp;results, Jackman and Furness chose another path to&nbsp;achieve their long-awaited parenthood. They decided to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>adopt</a> a&nbsp;child in&nbsp;2000. The new member of&nbsp;their family was named Oscar Maximilian.</p><p>According to&nbsp;the actress herself, they <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>were</a> both in&nbsp;the room where Oscar’s biological mother gave birth to&nbsp;him. Jackman even cut the umbilical cord, and the baby was placed directly into her arms.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7e1/f7f/f21ed95ca781d9116e7cf66715.jpg><p>5&nbsp;years later, the family fulfilled their dream team with an&nbsp;adopted daughter they called Ava Eliot.</p><p>The actor has declared that he&nbsp;does not consider them <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>adopted</a>, but his own, and he&nbsp;makes sure that they feel that way too. Eventually, despite the setbacks, Jackman and Furness assembled the family they had always dreamed&nbsp;of.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/26b/f96/f8242250a98a831e2c6a4c332a.jpg><p>The 2&nbsp;always try to&nbsp;show each other, with actions, how much they love one another. For example, in&nbsp;2016, they dropped everything and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>escaped</a> for a&nbsp;week to&nbsp;the Caribbean to&nbsp;relive their honeymoon.&nbsp;2&nbsp;years later, they chose to&nbsp;do&nbsp;the same thing, but this time they went to&nbsp;Capri, Italy. In&nbsp;2021, the lovebirds celebrated their silver wedding anniversary, and Jackman took the time to&nbsp;dedicate some beautiful words to&nbsp;his wife through a&nbsp;post on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Instagram</a>.</p><p>“Being married to&nbsp;you, Deb, is&nbsp;as&nbsp;natural as&nbsp;breathing. From nearly the moment we&nbsp;met ... I&nbsp;knew our destiny was to&nbsp;be&nbsp;together. In&nbsp;our 25&nbsp;years&nbsp;— our love has only grown deeper. The fun, excitement, and adventure more exhilarating; the learning even greater. I’m forever grateful to&nbsp;share our love, our life&nbsp;— and our family together. We’ve only just begun. Deb, I&nbsp;love you with all my&nbsp;heart!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/52d/cd0/7f27fc52aa938f3d5bde75c6ec.jpg><p>This year, Jackman and Furness celebrated 26&nbsp;years of&nbsp;marriage, and they only seem to&nbsp;grow stronger and love each other more as&nbsp;time goes&nbsp;on.</p><p>Throughout these decades together, respect for one another, admiration, and mutual trust have weighed much more than the 13-year <a href=# title="age gap" data-link=tag>age gap</a>. Sure, it&nbsp;will always be&nbsp;there, but it&nbsp;only proves that for true love, age is&nbsp;nothing more than a&nbsp;number on&nbsp;an&nbsp;ID.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/df7/3b5/adbf0f580b97382680952450e3.jpg><p>What love story do&nbsp;you know where an&nbsp;age gap did not stop a&nbsp;couple from achieving a&nbsp;happy ending?
