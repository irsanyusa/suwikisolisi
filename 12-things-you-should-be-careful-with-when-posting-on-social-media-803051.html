Posting too much information about people’s personal lives exposes them to&nbsp;various risks that range from identity theft to&nbsp;defamation. Because of&nbsp;this, before uploading things to&nbsp;the internet, it’s important to&nbsp;think twice and make sure we&nbsp;do&nbsp;everything we&nbsp;can to&nbsp;avoid posting anything that could later become a&nbsp;bigger problem than it&nbsp;should&nbsp;be.</p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>made a&nbsp;compilation with some of&nbsp;the most common types of&nbsp;posts we&nbsp;share online and did a&nbsp;little research to&nbsp;see how they can turn against&nbsp;us if&nbsp;we’re not careful enough.</p><p><h2>1. Your children’s pictures and personal data</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a91/ed3/4108c859e09a2727ec0f4f7a72.jpg><p>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>estimated</a> that today’s parents post approximately 1,000 pictures on&nbsp;different social media sites where you can see their children before they even reach the age of&nbsp;5. In&nbsp;addition, a&nbsp;large percentage of&nbsp;these children can be&nbsp;traced on&nbsp;the internet because there are pictures of&nbsp;them on&nbsp;these sites since before the age of&nbsp;2. This is&nbsp;exactly the sort of&nbsp;thing that can, later&nbsp;on, create a&nbsp;privacy problem. People start competing to&nbsp;get more likes while disregarding the danger of&nbsp;exposing their children to&nbsp;online public conversation.</p><p>But it&nbsp;is&nbsp;not just posting pictures that has become a&nbsp;risky thing to&nbsp;do. Providing <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>personal information</a> related to&nbsp;parenting and children’s health is&nbsp;also far from recommended. While many new parents consult social media to&nbsp;seek advice from others who could be&nbsp;more experienced, doing this could potentially lead to&nbsp;the child being embarrassed by&nbsp;being exposed in&nbsp;this way. Later&nbsp;on, the child might become a&nbsp;victim of&nbsp;harassment and cyberbullying.</p><p><h2>2. Your date of&nbsp;birth</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/730/0aa/4cc8385d55b1c0c0bd6b3ae2d0.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Publishing</a> your date of&nbsp;birth so&nbsp;that your contacts on&nbsp;social media get notifications and congratulate you is&nbsp;a&nbsp;common thing that many people do&nbsp;nowadays. However, while it&nbsp;seems meaningless at&nbsp;first, revealing this information is&nbsp;much riskier than most people realize. This is&nbsp;because security questions to&nbsp;recover a&nbsp;password often include this information since it’s one of&nbsp;the easiest things to&nbsp;remember. Making it&nbsp;public might backfire in&nbsp;this case, as&nbsp;you’re making the info available to&nbsp;everyone at&nbsp;all times.</p><p>Another potential risk that you could be&nbsp;facing when making your date of&nbsp;birth public on&nbsp;your profile is&nbsp;allowing others to&nbsp;find out your password for bank accounts or&nbsp;credit cards. Since it’s usually made up&nbsp;of&nbsp;4&nbsp;digits, many people use their birthday, which&nbsp;is, of&nbsp;course, not really recommended. And, while many take precautions by&nbsp;creating new “combinations” with these numbers thinking that they will avoid identity theft by&nbsp;doing&nbsp;so, the best way to&nbsp;make sure your data is&nbsp;safe is&nbsp;to&nbsp;simply not make it&nbsp;public.</p><p><h2>3. Fake news</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8c2/fb6/fe55745749b9c56af97bebb661.jpg><p>It’s hard to&nbsp;deny that sharing information on&nbsp;social media can contribute to&nbsp;creating an&nbsp;atmosphere of&nbsp;free speech. However, it’s important to&nbsp;understand that this new freedom comes with a&nbsp;catch, and like in&nbsp;most cases, one should try and look at&nbsp;the other side of&nbsp;things. Social media can also contribute to&nbsp;the creation and dissemination of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>fake news</a>. These are usually created with different intentions in&nbsp;mind, but in&nbsp;some cases, they’ve been known to&nbsp;discredit a&nbsp;person or&nbsp;a&nbsp;company, to&nbsp;turn misleading content viral, or&nbsp;to&nbsp;get people related to&nbsp;an&nbsp;idea to&nbsp;reinforce their concepts on&nbsp;certain topics.</p><p>Creating and sharing fake news can have several undesirable <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>consequences</a>. Among them are the increase of&nbsp;hostility toward certain groups, the attack on&nbsp;a&nbsp;person’s integrity, and the loss of&nbsp;the reputation of&nbsp;a&nbsp;company or&nbsp;the media that contributed to&nbsp;its dissemination. Because of&nbsp;all these reasons, it’s always a&nbsp;good idea to&nbsp;run a&nbsp;quick search and sometimes to&nbsp;even investigate what you read online thoroughly to&nbsp;make sure that the article or&nbsp;information in&nbsp;question comes from a&nbsp;reliable source&nbsp;or, at&nbsp;least, that it&nbsp;is&nbsp;endorsed by&nbsp;a&nbsp;professional expert on&nbsp;the subject.</p><p><h2>4. Private conversations</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/531/133/a174825ff28945b27a97a7afaa.jpg><p>There are many people out there who find no&nbsp;issue in&nbsp;sharing screenshots of&nbsp;private WhatsApp conversations. This, by&nbsp;the way, applies to&nbsp;any other messaging service. Even in&nbsp;the rare cases when we&nbsp;have the other person’s consent, doing so&nbsp;might be&nbsp;considered a&nbsp;crime in&nbsp;several countries if&nbsp;you end up&nbsp;violating the right to&nbsp;communicate privately, revealing secrets, and/or damaging the reputation of&nbsp;someone involved in&nbsp;the conversation.</p><p>Although there are many nuances to&nbsp;this issue, individuals or&nbsp;media outlets that share a&nbsp;private conversation can be&nbsp;denounced by&nbsp;people whose lives can be&nbsp;affected by&nbsp;a&nbsp;reckless screenshot. That is&nbsp;why, to&nbsp;avoid any legal problems, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;best to&nbsp;treat personal matters as&nbsp;what they are meant to&nbsp;be: personal. Refrain from sharing personal conversations with friends or&nbsp;third parties that weren’t involved in&nbsp;the first place.</p><p><h2>5. Pictures showing something potentially embarrassing or&nbsp;containing secret information</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3cd/3b1/0fe1e1577c941a52a17e97acd2.jpg><p>Regardless of&nbsp;how harmless the picture that you upload to&nbsp;social media might seem, you should always think twice before making it&nbsp;public. Remember, if&nbsp;you don’t pay attention to&nbsp;what appears in&nbsp;the picture, you might end up&nbsp;revealing sensitive information. Clearly, these types of&nbsp;incidents have happened and could cause a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;problems. Think, for example, of&nbsp;that one time <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>pictures</a> of&nbsp;<a href=# title="Prince William" data-link=tag>Prince William</a>’s workplace were posted online. Incidentally, they happened to&nbsp;reveal the password to&nbsp;the UK&nbsp;Ministry of&nbsp;Defense systems. The government was then forced to&nbsp;reset the whole system and change its password.</p><p>This example illustrates an&nbsp;important lesson about online privacy: if&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;picture of&nbsp;yourself at&nbsp;your workplace, at&nbsp;home, or&nbsp;wherever you are, you should make sure to&nbsp;not show your computer screen, bank statements, travel tickets, or&nbsp;any other document containing confidential information. In&nbsp;any case, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;best to&nbsp;double-check the picture before posting it&nbsp;online, just to&nbsp;make sure there are no&nbsp;embarrassing details or&nbsp;sensitive information that could later be&nbsp;used against you.</p><p><h2>6. Insults to&nbsp;other people</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2e4/9fd/916d7f5092b42458e3bde79a6c.jpg><p>You know that, depending on&nbsp;the place you’re in, you are supposed to&nbsp;behave in&nbsp;one way or&nbsp;the other. For example, if&nbsp;you’re at&nbsp;the office you won’t act the same way as&nbsp;if&nbsp;you were at&nbsp;home or&nbsp;a&nbsp;restaurant. This is&nbsp;just as&nbsp;important when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;posting things online. There’s a&nbsp;certain code of&nbsp;behavior that you are supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;following on&nbsp;social media. In&nbsp;this case, what you should avoid is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>insulting</a> someone online, ridiculing them, or&nbsp;making fun of&nbsp;a&nbsp;mistake they may have made.</p><p>Of&nbsp;course, what’s also true is&nbsp;that the way we&nbsp;behave offline is&nbsp;very different from how we&nbsp;act or&nbsp;what we&nbsp;show online. But every bad action, disrespectful incident, or&nbsp;moment of&nbsp;humiliation can have serious consequences for all the parties concerned. Therefore, before insulting someone on&nbsp;social media, stop and think for a&nbsp;minute. Ask yourself whether or&nbsp;not you’d like them to&nbsp;do&nbsp;the same to&nbsp;you and think about how you would react if&nbsp;someone made fun of&nbsp;your pictures or&nbsp;comments online. Empathy is&nbsp;key to&nbsp;understanding people, even online.</p><p><h2>7. Pictures of&nbsp;other people that infringe on&nbsp;their dignity</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e8b/145/cb3338521583d7325037c1e931.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Posting pictures on&nbsp;social media</a> has become such a&nbsp;common thing to&nbsp;do&nbsp;that we&nbsp;do&nbsp;not always take into account the consequences of&nbsp;making some of&nbsp;these images public. This is&nbsp;especially true for pics that give a&nbsp;glimpse into our personal life. Clearly, we’re not talking merely about selfies or&nbsp;pics that we&nbsp;post, but also about those done by&nbsp;third parties without your authorization, and that can damage your reputation when they go&nbsp;viral online.</p><p>Sharing images that promote violence and discrimination affects not only the subject of&nbsp;these photos but also the people who share them. For example, you might end up&nbsp;being banned from Facebook and having your account blocked for violating the content standards of&nbsp;the platform. And, in&nbsp;more serious situations, you can even face a&nbsp;trial for not respecting the privacy of&nbsp;third parties. As&nbsp;you can see, it’s a&nbsp;very serious issue, so&nbsp;it’s important to&nbsp;take these things into account when posting online.</p><p><h2>8. Too much personal information</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/70e/1f6/71a4be5f7b97176dd5035c6b8e.jpg><p>When creating an&nbsp;account on&nbsp;any social media, you may find <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>several boxes</a> to&nbsp;fill&nbsp;in: name and surname, date of&nbsp;birth, address, telephone, and email, among others. Whenever you face these types of&nbsp;situations, you should always make sure to&nbsp;not provide too much information that could become public. Doing so&nbsp;could lead to&nbsp;harassment and unwanted attention by&nbsp;people you don’t really know. Most social media companies have ways of&nbsp;making your personal information private.</p><p>Among the data that is&nbsp;not recommended to&nbsp;be&nbsp;published as&nbsp;public information are, of&nbsp;course, your home address, telephone number, and even pictures of&nbsp;your family and friends. Remember that any of&nbsp;these could potentially fall into the hands of&nbsp;cybercriminals that could use them to&nbsp;steal your identity and in&nbsp;the worst-case scenario, even your money. In&nbsp;any case, it’s always best to&nbsp;set your basic profile information in&nbsp;such a&nbsp;way that only your contacts can see&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>9. Too much information about your love life</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a11/d5f/bb001d51339d0b0171a13b0c0e.jpg><p>If&nbsp;you are in&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;normal to&nbsp;want to&nbsp;upload photos with your partner. In&nbsp;fact, it’s believed that this <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>practice</a> can both generate a&nbsp;greater connection between the 2&nbsp;of&nbsp;you and prevent others from having a&nbsp;love interest in&nbsp;you or&nbsp;your partner. But as&nbsp;with everything in&nbsp;life, you should find a&nbsp;healthy balance between posting what you want and making sure you’re not giving away information about someone else.</p><p>There are <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>situations</a> where photos or&nbsp;statuses dedicated to&nbsp;partners may reflect insecurities or&nbsp;be&nbsp;interpreted as&nbsp;hints to&nbsp;others. In&nbsp;these cases, the best thing to&nbsp;do&nbsp;is&nbsp;to&nbsp;moderate your posts and spend time together.</p><p><h2>10. Images protected by&nbsp;copyright</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a09/682/3d2799583293a0b0bac45cc731.jpg><p>If&nbsp;you see an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>illustration or&nbsp;pictures</a> that you like and you want to&nbsp;share them online, you should start by&nbsp;finding out who created it&nbsp;and if&nbsp;it&nbsp;has any specific requirements to&nbsp;be&nbsp;shared. You should also ask the original artist if&nbsp;you can use it&nbsp;and, by&nbsp;doing&nbsp;so, you’ll obtain written proof of&nbsp;their confirmation that will cover your back in&nbsp;case there’s a&nbsp;claim for replicating it&nbsp;without their authorization.</p><p>There are some exceptions to&nbsp;this rule, for example, public domain images, which can be&nbsp;posted anywhere without having to&nbsp;ask for permission prior to&nbsp;doing&nbsp;it. However, keep in&nbsp;mind that if&nbsp;they’re copyrighted they might have a&nbsp;license. In&nbsp;that case, you should read the requirements carefully to&nbsp;find out if&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;needed or&nbsp;not, to&nbsp;clarify the authorship of&nbsp;the image and, if&nbsp;possible, post the link to&nbsp;the original source as&nbsp;well.</p><p><h2>11. Your pet’s name, your favorite color, or&nbsp;other possible answers to&nbsp;“security questions”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e42/480/972dfb5c76b2f5f5ccf8136476.jpg><p>A&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>study</a> claims that security questions are often weaker than passwords themselves, which could pose a&nbsp;threat to&nbsp;your privacy online. This is&nbsp;likely to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the case because questions are often so&nbsp;easy that anyone can answer them. You’ve probably run into questions like, “What is&nbsp;your pet’s name?” or&nbsp;“What is&nbsp;your favorite color?” Unwittingly, you may provide these answers on&nbsp;your social media, making yourself vulnerable to&nbsp;account theft.</p><p>If&nbsp;you answer this question with your pet’s name, avoid mentioning it&nbsp;when uploading its pictures on&nbsp;social media. Or, in&nbsp;any case, create a&nbsp;fake answer to&nbsp;mislead the intruder, both in&nbsp;this and in&nbsp;other security questions.</p><p><h2>12. Biometric or&nbsp;medical information</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/38b/42c/a257a859ad9cbefdc8df0978bf.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Medical and biometric data</a> typically falls under the umbrella of&nbsp;what anybody would understand as&nbsp;“confidential information.” Clearly, this is&nbsp;something that you should not share online since it&nbsp;could make you vulnerable in&nbsp;many ways. And in&nbsp;case you have a&nbsp;sick relative or&nbsp;friend, avoid giving precise information about their health condition. This is&nbsp;private and sensitive information that should be&nbsp;shared solely by&nbsp;the person concerned or&nbsp;by&nbsp;professionals.</p><p>If&nbsp;you are a&nbsp;doctor, avoid sharing images or&nbsp;X-rays on&nbsp;social media groups or&nbsp;communities without your patient’s consent. But if&nbsp;you do&nbsp;it&nbsp;for professional purposes, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;best to&nbsp;omit any personal data that may appear on&nbsp;the image.</p><p>What problems do&nbsp;you remember experiencing after sharing certain data on&nbsp;your social networks?
