She fell out of the competition during the 6 Chair Challenge, but they decided to bring her back when another contestant dropped out.</strong></p><p>Honey G was quite the character on the show. There was a sharp division between the fans of the show and the judging panel due to her jaw dropping performances. Some saw her as nothing but a fake and not worthy of TV time, while others saw her as valuable talent. I think we can all agree that she defintely accomplished the goal of becoming household name in Britain… and somewhat of a culture icon.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-honey-g-s-career-change>Honey G’s Career Change</h2><p>With such a memorable time on The X Factor, many are wondering what she could possibly be up to six years later. Right after The X Factor she dedicated her time to making and performing more rap music. In the final she announced that she had been signed by Simon Cowell’s company, Syco Records. Since the announcement she released her debut single, “The Honey G Show.” The single peaked at No. 149 on the UK Singles Chart.</p><p>In 2017, the rapper announced that she would be launching an independent record company since she was dropped by Syco Records. Since 2016, she’s released five singles. Her last single was <a href=#>released in 2020</a> with JEDIK, uslord, and Santiment.</p><p>In 2018 Honey G’s career totally changed. She became a real estate agent at Chancellors Estate Agents in London, but it only lasted for 40 days. Fans were stunned by Honey G’s sophisticated looks, but she was later asked to choose between the job and her music career to continue.</p><p>The rapper shared that she wasn’t ready to give up on her dream of becoming a worldwide music artist. She later admitted that she had no intention of becoming a real estate agent for long term. Instead, she was looking for structure in her life amid her music career.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B7B7ncJp2yc/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What’s Next For Honey G?</h2><p>During the Covid-19 lockdown, the rapper took the time to develop healthy habits. At this time she began working on weight loss. She announced in the same year that she lost 2 stone (around 30 pounds). Her Instagram shares that she’s competed in two triathlons and multiple other runs for causes. Honey G is currently working with the Mental Health Foundation.</p><p>In a 2020 interview the rapper opened up about how she has once spiraled into a dark place in life. She had been car-jacked, kidnapped and sexually assaulted in 2004. During the time she was in college and running her own club in Manchester. There was enough evidence for the man to face conviction without being present in court. From this attack she suffered loss of confidence and panic attacks. To cope with the trauma she attended Dialectical Behavior Therapy sessions. Honey G suffers with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder to this day following the attack.</p><p>Right now, Honey G is working with SRL Publishing to release her life story. It was originally reported that her book would release in 2022, so fans can expect to see it soon. In Jan 2022, Honey G was apart of the sixth season of Celebrity Coach Trip. Celebrity Coach Trip is a game show where celebrities go on a 10 day tour and vote off the ones they don’t like.</p><p>No matter what you thought of Honey G during the show, at the end of the day she is a self-made star. Who is to judge what’s real or fake? Perhaps it was fake all along, but in the long run she has now found her true self in Honey G. Her’s is a story of courage, persistence, and fearlessness and she deserves all the credit in the world just.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CFdAU0WJ1kW/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-1320417305.jpg alt="Demi Lovato Wipes Instagram Photos, Prepares Fans For Genre Change" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qGcq51dnsBuxIyfmJysn6fAbq%2FOp6urp6aav7S1wKVkq5mgpbKzeceopZ6xXZx6qrqMa2dral8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./best-oscar-winning-disney-songs.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>10 Best Oscar-Winning Disney Original Songs</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./taxe-sur-les-bigtech-pour-une-majorite-de-pays-europeens-cest-non.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>pour une majorit de pays europens, c'est non!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2027-deputy-speaker-kalu-joins-call-for-gov-otti-to-join-apc.html>2027: Deputy Speaker, Kalu joins call for Gov Otti to join APC</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bruxelles-accorde-une-subvention-de-356-millions-deuros-aux-victimes-de-xynthia.html>Bruxelles accorde une subvention de 35,6 millions d'euros aux victimes de Xynthia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./prise-en-compte-de-la-penibilite-dans-la-fonction-publique-large-desaccord-entre-le-gouvernement-et.html>dsaccord sur les dparts anticips des fonctionnaires</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./events.html>Historical Events in April 1920</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1258549-nicole-kidman-bio-age-height-husband-children-net-worth-html.html>Nicole Kidman bio: age, height, husband, children, net worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVlog.
