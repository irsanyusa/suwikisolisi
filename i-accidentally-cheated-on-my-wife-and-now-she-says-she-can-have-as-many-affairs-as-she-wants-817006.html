And when one partner cheats, it’s often a&nbsp;challenge for the second one to&nbsp;choose whether to&nbsp;forgive or&nbsp;to&nbsp;end a&nbsp;<a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a>. Our today’s hero is&nbsp;a&nbsp;man, who cheated on&nbsp;his wife only once, and he&nbsp;thought things have settled up&nbsp;in&nbsp;his family after that. But his wife served him a&nbsp;bitter dish with her own behavior, and now the man can’t figure out what to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with his family life.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;man appeared in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very whimsical situation.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/222/7e9/9b7a6e5fa8ad65f3d40a1ae5c0.jpg><p>An&nbsp;anonymous 32-year-old man took to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Reddit</a> to&nbsp;share that he&nbsp;and his 29-year-old wife were having a&nbsp;real <a href=# title=drama data-link=tag>drama</a> in&nbsp;their family. He&nbsp;wrote that they had been married for five years. And in&nbsp;the second year of&nbsp;their happy relationship, he&nbsp;had an&nbsp;affair, which wasn’t a&nbsp;long-lasting one and happened accidentally. He&nbsp;revealed the truth to&nbsp;his wife and their marriage seemed to&nbsp;have been restored, but it&nbsp;turned out things went a&nbsp;very wrong way.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f40/053/fc3b1855e281bf648e6c2e20d5.jpg><p>The man states that his wife was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>able</a> to&nbsp;forgive him for his affair, and they even went to&nbsp;marriage counseling to&nbsp;make their marriage work out after such a&nbsp;trial for both. But one day, he&nbsp;revealed that all this time his wife was playing pretend and probably had something in&nbsp;her mind. It&nbsp;was his discovery, even not the affair itself, that was the beginning of&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge family dilemma, which the desperate man is&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;solve now.</p><p><h2>The man’s discovery absolutely shocked him.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/68b/ce4/5a4e3b558cbeb5c5d41cb00309.jpg><p>Some days ago, while the man’s wife was in&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shower</a>, he&nbsp;went through her phone and found the texts confirming she was cheating. This totally broke him, both as&nbsp;a&nbsp;man and as&nbsp;a&nbsp;husband, and he&nbsp;wrote that he&nbsp;felt so&nbsp;betrayed. The man then confronted his wife after she got out of&nbsp;the shower. She said that her affairs were absolutely ok&nbsp;because he&nbsp;previously cheated on&nbsp;her and had set the precedent for allowing infidelity.</p><p>The man tried to&nbsp;convince his wife that his cheating was a&nbsp;half-conscious 1&nbsp;time thing and that he&nbsp;hadn’t had any affairs since. She also insisted that he&nbsp;didn’t even know the girl and his wife, on&nbsp;the contrary, now has a&nbsp;relationship with the guy. His wife’s reaction totally made him panic, as&nbsp;she got mad and stormed off. She then left for work, and the man hadn’t seen her since. He&nbsp;wrote that he’s totally sure she’s with that other man, and it&nbsp;hurt. He&nbsp;confessed that, on&nbsp;the one hand, he&nbsp;feels he&nbsp;deserves this, but at&nbsp;the same time he&nbsp;now wants his wife back.</p><p><h2>People’s advice and opinions about the whole situation were very different.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/815/2e2/d1eeee5ef6b54925f5b6436338.jpg><p>The post has gained more than <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>5,000</a>&nbsp;comments, and the users were really shocked by&nbsp;the whole situation. One user wrote, “She didn’t forgive you. She just stopped talking about&nbsp;it.” Another person shared their experience, saying, “I&nbsp;was with my&nbsp;ex&nbsp;for 7&nbsp;years, and we&nbsp;constantly fought about the same things over and over. He&nbsp;would cheat on&nbsp;me, lie, disrespect me&nbsp;— honestly a&nbsp;whole slew of&nbsp;issues and then get mad at&nbsp;me&nbsp;for ‘not letting things&nbsp;go’ or&nbsp;‘holding things over his head’ anytime&nbsp;I wanted to&nbsp;discuss it&nbsp;or&nbsp;express frustration.”</p><p>Many users supported the wife, saying that, no&nbsp;matter what was the reason for the husband’s affair, the wife had a&nbsp;right to&nbsp;pay him back. One person shared, “Truth right here, she never forgave you&nbsp;— when my&nbsp;ex&nbsp;cheated on&nbsp;me, I&nbsp;went and did it&nbsp;back, (2&nbsp;wrongs don’t make it&nbsp;right). Then it&nbsp;became toxic, we&nbsp;just started doing anything we&nbsp;could to&nbsp;hurt each other. I&nbsp;BECAME NUMB, AND when&nbsp;I finally said enough and got out of&nbsp;that relationship, he&nbsp;was all surprised and so&nbsp;was everyone else we&nbsp;knew&nbsp;— I&nbsp;had already gone through all the <a href=# title=emotions data-link=tag>emotions</a> of&nbsp;a&nbsp;break-up why&nbsp;I was still inside of&nbsp;what ever that was.
