The story created by&nbsp;David Lynch and Mark Frost lasted for 3&nbsp;seasons as&nbsp;a&nbsp;series, one full-length <a href=#>movie</a>, and several <a href=#>books</a>. But even the most thorough studies of&nbsp;all these materials don’t provide answers to&nbsp;all the (still outstanding) questions. There are numerous versions of&nbsp;things happening and each of&nbsp;them can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;clue.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side </strong>got familiar with the revolutionary theory that caused quite a&nbsp;stir on&nbsp;the internet recently and made&nbsp;us look at&nbsp;Lynch’s and Frost’s brainchild from an&nbsp;absolutely different angle.</p><p><h2>Twin Peaks is&nbsp;not what it&nbsp;seems to&nbsp;be.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a03/d57/f6fe0d5a0a81345f236f40324b.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2019, the Twin Perfect YouTube channel posted a&nbsp;4-hour <a href=#>video</a> where the author builds up&nbsp;the concept of&nbsp;Twin Peaks based on&nbsp;all kinds of&nbsp;interviews with the creators and actors of&nbsp;the series. According to&nbsp;him, everything that happens in&nbsp;this town is&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a href=# title=illusion data-link=tag>illusion</a> inside the movie and a&nbsp;range of&nbsp;signs indicate that this theory is&nbsp;true.</p><p><h2>The series begins with a&nbsp;sawmill for a&nbsp;reason.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/50b/26e/eb73555efda458168a15c0ff72.jpg><p>It’s hard to&nbsp;remember another detective series where a&nbsp;sawmill was shown. However, it&nbsp;plays quite an&nbsp;important role in&nbsp;Twin Peaks. One can see a&nbsp;hint of&nbsp;the unreality of&nbsp;things happening in&nbsp;the series because “sawing logs” is&nbsp;not just about sawing logs, but also about <a href=#>snoring</a> while sleeping. Thus, everything that happens is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=dream data-link=tag>dream</a>.</p><p>Some characters know about&nbsp;it. For example, agent Phillip Jeffries who is&nbsp;played by&nbsp;<a href=# title="David Bowie" data-link=tag>David Bowie</a> in&nbsp;the full-length movie Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with&nbsp;Me, appears in&nbsp;the FBI office during one scene and <a href=#>says</a>, “We&nbsp;live inside a&nbsp;dream.”</p><p><h2>Crime investigation is&nbsp;a&nbsp;symbol of&nbsp;television.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4ac/184/5c81d25e27b6b3374ea5a62d3f.jpg><p>The words about living in&nbsp;a&nbsp;dream shouldn’t be&nbsp;taken too literally. Living in&nbsp;a&nbsp;dream can mean there is&nbsp;some illusion, and that you are living by&nbsp;other people’s rules. The rules of&nbsp;the game are usually predetermined for the characters of&nbsp;a&nbsp;TV show. Therefore, the murder of&nbsp;Laura Palmer and further investigation should be&nbsp;taken as&nbsp;a&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;staging.</p><p><h2>The red room is&nbsp;the backstage.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bb7/e75/13eba9521081cc889a61b9943b.jpg><p>Theater curtains are <a href=#>mostly</a> red all over the world. Red curtains are there in&nbsp;the famous room for a&nbsp;reason. It’s backstage where those characters who suspect, or&nbsp;know, that everything happening in&nbsp;the town is&nbsp;unreal end&nbsp;up.</p><p><h2>Lights should be&nbsp;paid attention to&nbsp;as&nbsp;well.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c1d/424/9fd2525088bf148dbf3d1dd744.jpg><p>We&nbsp;can see a&nbsp;circle of&nbsp;light on&nbsp;the actors in&nbsp;the tensest scenes, and again, you can see a&nbsp;hint of&nbsp;theatricality in&nbsp;them. The director of&nbsp;the movie highlights the moments that are significant for the plot with the help of&nbsp;light, imitating a&nbsp;spotlight. In&nbsp;the series, this effect is&nbsp;most often used when some kind of&nbsp;atrocity occurs.</p><p><h2>Agent Cooper represents all of&nbsp;us.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/644/3bc/5c25685d92b2237196fce399ff.jpg><p>Many people outlined that Dale Cooper doesn’t act like an&nbsp;FBI agent. He&nbsp;seeks the truth while relying on&nbsp;symbols. For example, he&nbsp;asks his assistant to&nbsp;read the names aloud as&nbsp;he&nbsp;throws stones at&nbsp;the bottle and if&nbsp;the stone reaches the target (hits the bottle), it&nbsp;will signify the involvement of&nbsp;this person in&nbsp;the crime. The thing&nbsp;is, Cooper represents all of&nbsp;us&nbsp;— the viewers. We&nbsp;need to&nbsp;solve the mystery of&nbsp;Twin Peaks.</p><p><h2>The Giant and the Arm</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/81a/250/73b03e5e5aabb8284b4de1cd23.jpg><p>Both characters are alleged spirits of&nbsp;cinematography. In&nbsp;the third season, we&nbsp;can see that the Giant lives in&nbsp;a&nbsp;black-and-white theater. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;the spirit of&nbsp;big cinema and Laura Palmer is&nbsp;a&nbsp;figment of&nbsp;his imagination. Perhaps David Lynch depicted himself in&nbsp;this character, because he&nbsp;is&nbsp;the master of&nbsp;full-length movies and Laura Palmer was created by&nbsp;his imagination.</p><p>There is&nbsp;an&nbsp;evil spirit living behind the curtains&nbsp;— the Arm, or&nbsp;The Man from Another Place. At&nbsp;the same time, the director doesn’t conceal that that little man is&nbsp;an&nbsp;independently living arm of&nbsp;the character named Mike. Therefore, Mike is&nbsp;the spirit of&nbsp;television itself, where kindness and evil are supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;balanced. But this happened and the evil part separated itself and focused on&nbsp;this new creature that is&nbsp;playing its own game.</p><p><h2>Bob</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d0c/c3b/7f11f353638591e14c1630c6b0.jpg><p>The evil named Bob represents cruelty for fun. He&nbsp;takes possession of&nbsp;the series’ characters and makes them commit crimes, thereby causing the suffering of&nbsp;the inhabitants of&nbsp;the backstage that they feed&nbsp;on. In&nbsp;the first season, Bob’s face turns into the owl’s face for a&nbsp;moment. It&nbsp;would be&nbsp;logical to&nbsp;assume that Bob can turn into or&nbsp;take possession of&nbsp;the owl and travel through the town.</p><p><h2>What do&nbsp;owls actually mean?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d07/edb/02b1a850f18c6d19fb41f6ddf7.jpg><p>The phrase, “The owls are not what they seem,” is&nbsp;known even by&nbsp;those who have never watched Twin Peaks. According to&nbsp;some fans, this bird became one of&nbsp;the symbols of&nbsp;the universe&nbsp;— both the series and the movie are literally <a href=#>infested</a> with owls if&nbsp;you look closely: there are lamps in&nbsp;the shape of&nbsp;owls and various statuettes that can be&nbsp;found in&nbsp;almost every scene. Since Bob, who sometimes appears in&nbsp;the form of&nbsp;the owl, personifies cruelty on&nbsp;television, owls in&nbsp;literally every Twin Peaks home mean that Bob has penetrated any place that has a&nbsp;TV.</p><p>But that’s not all. In&nbsp;the last episode of&nbsp;season 3, Agent Cooper is&nbsp;meaningfully looking at&nbsp;the&nbsp;TV tower, which also resembles an&nbsp;owl, and says, “This is&nbsp;the very place.” Just like Bob travels using the body of&nbsp;the owl, television cruelty travels the world with the help of&nbsp;TV towers.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;fine cup of&nbsp;coffee</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7c8/479/443bb657c68c5c7565a786cb60.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the series, Agent Cooper awards his favorite drink with various epithets and even declares that he&nbsp;can’t work without coffee and doughnuts at&nbsp;all. This means that the coffee is&nbsp;a&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;fuel, thanks to&nbsp;which the plot can continue developing. When Cooper gets into the Red Room, his coffee changes its density several times, which prevents him from swallowing. This substance is&nbsp;under the control of&nbsp;the creatures behind the scenes, who decide whether to&nbsp;move the investigation further or&nbsp;not.</p><p><h2>Revealing the name of&nbsp;the criminal is&nbsp;the victory of&nbsp;evil.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0ed/047/65778f5a7ba364f6516095a075.jpg><p>The most avid fans of&nbsp;the series know that David Lynch <a href=#>didn’t want</a> to&nbsp;reveal the name of&nbsp;the criminal at&nbsp;all, but he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;surrender to&nbsp;the pressure of&nbsp;the studio, which resulted in&nbsp;the fading popularity of&nbsp;the series. The director was trying to&nbsp;pay more attention to&nbsp;the personality of&nbsp;Laura Palmer, which was unfolding by&nbsp;revealing more about her surroundings. Perhaps he&nbsp;didn’t want the viewers to&nbsp;perceive atrocities on&nbsp;the&nbsp;TV show as&nbsp;a&nbsp;conveyer, when no&nbsp;one remembers the victim and craves new emotions after exposing the villain. But this was exactly what happened. The viewer learned who the murderer was and it&nbsp;was no&nbsp;longer important who Laura herself was.</p><p><h2>Maddy</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d5c/be0/6009dc5dedbe1f4cd2277a72b7.jpg><p>Maddy’s destiny <a href=#>brings</a> writers David Bushman and Arthur Smith, who are investigating the world of&nbsp;Twin Peaks, to&nbsp;the thought that despite the abundance of&nbsp;seemingly absurd events in&nbsp;the show, it&nbsp;stems from the creators’ resentment about the evil that humans are capable&nbsp;of. Also, the writers call Maddy the most tragic character because the viewers had a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;get to&nbsp;know her well, unlike Laura, who was played by&nbsp;the same actress.</p><p><h2>What doppelgängers mean</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/252/5ee/180ab355e68f56d86c03f1c51a.jpg><p>If&nbsp;we&nbsp;take into account the statement that Dale Cooper personifies the&nbsp;TV audience, then the creation of&nbsp;his evil twin also makes sense. There should be&nbsp;a&nbsp;balance between good and evil in&nbsp;each person. Getting the negative influence from Bob, aka television evil, the dark side of&nbsp;the audience, who watches the show for entertainment only, comes to&nbsp;the foreground.</p><p><h2>Audrey Horne’s dance</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d4d/003/4e22b75f218feadb9170c2e13e.jpg><p>The girl who falls in&nbsp;love with Dale Cooper, and strives to&nbsp;help him, symbolizes the happiness that is&nbsp;a&nbsp;reward for virtue. The creators even wanted to&nbsp;start a&nbsp;relationship between the characters but had to&nbsp;<a href=#>rewrite</a> the scenario because of&nbsp;the jealousy of&nbsp;the actor’s real partner. Audrey’s dance is&nbsp;a&nbsp;dream about love and a&nbsp;bright future, and nothing disturbs it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the first season, but by&nbsp;the third season, the woman is&nbsp;interrupted by&nbsp;someone’s fight. The on-screen violence won and perhaps happiness is&nbsp;lost forever.</p><p><h2>Pay attention to&nbsp;which year the lumberjacks appear&nbsp;in.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ded/ec3/707c17527bb060597d09572ede.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the third season of&nbsp;Twin Peaks, after the appearance of&nbsp;the numbers “1956,” a&nbsp;lumberjack comes out of&nbsp;the blue, sneaks into the radio tower, and starts to&nbsp;hypnotize the listeners, calling them to&nbsp;“drink water from the well.” Hearing his call over the radio waves, everyone falls asleep. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;noteworthy that in&nbsp;April 1956, the first 30-minute soap opera <a href=#>was released</a> on&nbsp;TV screens, and this format became mega-popular with viewers. People around the world become literally hypnotized by&nbsp;their favorite series with numerous episodes.</p><p><h2>What Garmonbozia actually is</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3ea/abc/de55185e048d9d170a6468e73d.jpg><p>Creatures from the Black Lodge feed on&nbsp;<a href=#>Garmonbozia</a>&nbsp;— a&nbsp;substance made from the sufferings and sorrows of&nbsp;its victims, which looks like corn puree. It&nbsp;begs the question of&nbsp;why the creators associated the things mentioned above with a&nbsp;dish made of&nbsp;corn. Now let’s try to&nbsp;remember what we&nbsp;like to&nbsp;eat when watching movies in&nbsp;general&nbsp;— it’s popcorn, which is&nbsp;a&nbsp;snack made of&nbsp;corn. Also, <a href=#>TV&nbsp;dinners</a> used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;popular in&nbsp;the USA some time ago&nbsp;— it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;small tray of&nbsp;food that was consumed while watching TV. Oftentimes, it&nbsp;also had garnishes made of&nbsp;corn. That’s why we&nbsp;can conclude that Garmonbozia is&nbsp;a&nbsp;corn dish that symbolizes our attention. That’s what evil feeds on&nbsp;as&nbsp;we&nbsp;keep watching the crimes in&nbsp;the&nbsp;TV show.</p><p><h2>What David Lynch was trying to&nbsp;tell&nbsp;us with all this</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e90/0a1/a1474555c0923123e2f5306fec.jpg><p>Of&nbsp;course, there are still many mysteries and secrets left. But after analyzing the aforementioned things, we&nbsp;can conclude that the director dislikes television. It’s the on-screen violence that wins in&nbsp;a&nbsp;fight for the viewers’ attention. This means that Bob took over the minds of&nbsp;many more people, not literally, but symbolically. Still, everything is&nbsp;not that sad. Perhaps the good is&nbsp;just sleeping waiting for its time&nbsp;— just like Cooper in&nbsp;the Red Room.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you like Twin Peaks?
