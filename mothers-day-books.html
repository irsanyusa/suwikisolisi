From <a href=#>Nicole Chung’s</a> luminous memoir <i>A Living Remedy, </i>about grieving the death of her adoptive mother and father, to Sara Peterson’s <i>Momfluenced, </i>an interrogation of the <a href=#>“momfluencer” industry</a>, there’s a book for every type of reader.

For Maisie, whose children range from 8 years old to a newborn, motherhood is as bewildering as it is overwhelming, an experience she finds at times repetitive and at others euphoric. She’s consumed with pressures both small and large: the banality of household chores, the unsolicited judgments of other parents and strangers, a looming debt. During a family outing to an apple farm, Maisie’s world is colored by a dizzying cycle of anxieties and joys.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy Now</strong>: In the Orchard<i> </i>on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b><i>A Living Remedy</i></b><b>, Nicole Chung</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ALivingRemedy.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In <i>A Living Remedy</i>, TIME contributor <a href=# rel=noopener>Nicole Chung</a>’s memoir about <a href=# rel=noopener>grieving her adoptive parents</a>, she explores the heartbreaking complexities of loss and the enduring power of love.

Despite the sobering subject matter, Chung—who chronicled the challenges of her transracial racial adoption in her first memoir <i>All You Can Ever Know</i> with deep empathy—channels the same care and compassion in her latest work.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy Now</strong>: <i>A Living Remedy </i>on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=# rel=noopener>I Thought I’d Get to See My Mother Again.

In the book, he examines the person he’s come to be as a way of understanding his mother, the most significant figure in his life. As McDonell’s only living parent, Irma’s tenacity in the face of struggle (from being widowed when McDonell was just five months old to later surviving a relationship the author describes as abusive) leaves an indelible mark on her son, affecting his choices and the trajectory of his life.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy Now</strong>: <i>Irma </i>on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b><i>Momfluenced: Inside the Maddening, Picture-Perfect World of Mommy Influencer Culture</i></b><b>, Sara Peterson</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Momfluenced.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In <i>Momfluenced</i>, Sara Peterson takes mommy influencer culture to task, revealing the big business and bigger consequences of selling aspirational motherhood on social media.

For Anh, Minh, and Thanh, three siblings escaping Vietnam after the war, a new start is just around the corner; they’re headed to the U.S. by way of Hong Kong, with their parents and younger siblings set to follow later. But when a storm leads to mass casualties on their family’s boat, Anh, the eldest sister, becomes the sole caretaker for her two younger brothers. Together, the three fight to survive not only their devastating grief, but also the harsh realities of their new lives as refugees. With compassion and clarity, Pin describes the ways a family cares for one another in the wake of life-altering tragedy.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy Now</strong>: Wandering Souls<i> </i>on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b><i>The Wreck: A Daughter’s Memoir of Becoming a Mother</i></b><b>, Cassandra Jackson</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/TheWreck.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At the heart of Cassandra Jackson’s memoir <i>The Wreck</i> is a quest to understand long-buried secrets from her family’s past.
