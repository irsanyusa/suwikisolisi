On Wednesday, the leaders of Libya, France, Germany, Chad and Niger and four other countries agreed <a href=# rel=noopener>on a plan</a> to evacuate thousands of migrants stuck in Libyan detention camps.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The grainy undercover video appears to show smugglers selling off a dozen men outside of the capital city Tripoli.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Does anybody need a digger? This is a digger, a big strong man, he’ll dig,” said an auctioneer, according to CNN. “What am I bid, what am I bid?”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The report has drawn attention to an issue that aid and migrant groups say has gone on for years.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Why is there a slave trade in Libya?<strong><br></strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Libya is the main transit point for refugees and migrants trying to reach Europe by sea. In each of the last three years, 150,000 people have made the dangerous crossing across the Mediterranean Sea from Libya. For four years in a row, <a href=# rel=noopener>3,000 refugees</a> have died while attempting the journey, according to figures from the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the U.N.’s migration agency.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Libyan Coast Guard — supported with funds and resources from the E.U. and more specifically, Italy — has cracked down on boats smuggling refugees and migrants to Europe. With <a href=# rel=noopener>estimates</a> of 400,000 to almost one million people now bottled up Libya, detention centers are overrun and there are mounting reports of robbery, rape, and murder among migrants, according to a September<a href=# rel=noopener> report</a> by the U.N. human rights agency. Conditions in the centers have been <a href=# rel=noopener>described</a> as “horrific,” and among other abuses, migrants are vulnerable to being sold off as laborers in slave auctions.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It’s a total extortion machine,” Lenard Doyle, Director of Media and Communications for the IOM in Geneva tells TIME. “Fueled by the absolute rush of migrants through Libya thinking they can get out of poverty, following a dream that doesn’t exist.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The IOM <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a> in April that it had documented reports of “slave markets” along the migrant routes in North Africa “tormenting hundreds of young African men bound for Libya.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“There they become commodities to be bought, sold and discarded when they have no more value,” Doyle said in the April statement.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/gettyimages-696975984.jpg><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">How is Libya handling the crisis?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">According to CNN, the U.N.-backed Libyan government has launched a formal investigation into the allegations. But Libya is largely considered a failed state. Since Muammar Gaddafi, who ran the country for four decades, was ousted in 2011, the country has descended into civil war. A transitional government <a href=# rel=noopener>failed to implement</a> rule of law in the country, which has splintered into several factions of militias, tribes, and gangs. In lawless Libya, many see the slave trade and smuggling as a <a href=# rel=noopener>lucrative industry</a>. Tackling the country’s humanitarian crisis will require international assistance.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On Wednesday, Libya reached a deal with E.U. and African leaders to allow the emergency repatriation of refugees and migrants facing abuse in its detention centers. The government also agreed to open a transit center for vulnerable refugees after months of negotiations, <a href=# rel=noopener>according</a> to Reuters. The center is intended to safely house people before they are resettled or sent to a third country.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">How is the international community responding?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Following the publication of the video, there was outcry from all corners of the globe, with some nations recalling their ambassadors from Libya. Protesters rallied outside Libyan embassies across Africa and in Europe.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On Wednesday, African and European leaders met at a summit in the Ivory Coast and agreed on an urgent <a href=# rel=noopener>evacuation plan</a> that would see about 15,000 people flown out of Libya. Most of the migrants will be sent back to their home countries. Speaking at the summit, French President Emmanuel Macron, called the abuse “a crime against humanity” and vowed the summit members would “launch concrete military and policing action on the ground to dismantle those networks,” according to <a href=# rel=noopener>the Guardian</a>. The deal also included initiatives to target traffickers, including setting up a task force to dismantle trafficking networks, the BBC <a href=# rel=noopener>reports.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari expressed shock at how his compatriots were being treated “like goats.” On Wednesday, 242 Nigerian migrants were <a href=# rel=noopener>flown out</a> of Libya back to Nigeria.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The day before, the U.N. Security Council held an emergency meeting and said it would be “<a href=# rel=noopener>stepping up its work</a>” to stop the abuses. However, the U.N refugee agency said it faces “dramatic” funding gaps, especially for its operations in sub-Saharan Africa. “Slavery and other such egregious abuses of human rights have no place in the 21st century,” U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Since 2015, the IOM has repatriated 13,000 people from Libya under a voluntary program. But Doyle, the IOM spokesperson, says more needs to be done to stop migration at its core, particularly from tech companies who own online platforms where traffickers can falsely lure people into paying smugglers.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“They’re being completely misled into thinking that’s a happy future for them and being misled thorough social media,” he tells TIME.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Earlier this week, the foreign ministry of Rwanda said it would extend asylum to 30,000 mainly sub-Saharan Africans stuck in Libya. “Given our own history … we cannot remain silent when human beings are being mistreated and auctioned off like cattle,” the foreign ministry <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley condemned the abuses, saying: “To see the pictures of these men being treated like cattle, and to hear the auctioneer describe them as, quote, ‘big strong boys for farm work,’ should shock the conscience of us all.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“There are few greater violations of human rights and human dignity than this.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZuaGRngnd8jqWgm7GRYsCtrdWeZK2qkZmycA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./milestones-nov-6-1964.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Milestones: Nov. 6, 1964 | TIME</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-money-does-kathryn-crosby-make-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Money Does Kathryn Crosby Make?
