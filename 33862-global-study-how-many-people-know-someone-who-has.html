This includes 6% who say they themselves have confirmation they have had the disease, as well as 34% whose family has been affected and 33% whose friends caught it. (The figures don’t sum to 63% as for some people will have known people from more than one category who caught the disease).</p><p>Close behind are America, Poland and Italy, where 58-60% of people know someone who has tested positive for the virus.</p><p>Here in Britain, 57% know of someone who has been confirmed with the virus. One in twenty Britons (5%) say they have tested positive for COVID-19, with a quarter (26%) saying this has happened to a family member and 36% to a close friend.</p><p>People in China (4%) and Singapore (6%) are the least likely to know anyone who has definitely had the disease.</p><h3>How many people know someone who has become seriously unwell from COVID-19?</h3><p>Americans and Poles are the most likely to know someone whose health has been seriously harmed by coronavirus, at 33% and 31% respectively.</p><p>Spanish people (28%), Italians (27%) and Britons (27%) are also among the more likely to have seen someone close to them become severely sick from the disease.</p><h3>How many people know someone who has died from COVID-19?</h3><p>Americans and Italians are the most likely have lost a friend or family member to COVID-19, at 21%. (It is worth noting a separate YouGov poll conducted more recently in the US alone has that figure even higher, at 29%).</p><p>One in five Spanish and Polish people (19%) also say that someone close to them has died from the diseases, as do 18% of urban Indians.</p><p>Here in Britain, coronavirus has taken the life of someone close to one in eight Britons (13%). One in twenty Britons (5%) have lost seen a family member succumb to the disease, with 8% having lost a close friend.</p><p>People in China and Singapore are the least likely to have lost someone they love to the disease, at just 2% in each country.</p><p><a href=#><strong>See the full results here</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtktaaty62faJmiqbakuMSsZmxraGt%2FbrPLqJmapF2owbaw2GafqK9doq6vxYypnKionJp6rLrOsGSsp52avK%2BxjLCfqGWYlsBu</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jamie-foxx-anthony-mackie-johnnie-cochran-movie-1202598386.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jamie Foxx Joins Anthony Mackies Johnnie Cochran Movie</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./deux-deputees-chargees-de-preparer-lacte-ii-de-la-loi-montagne.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Deux dputes charges de prparer l'acte II de la loi Montagne</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2027-deputy-speaker-kalu-joins-call-for-gov-otti-to-join-apc.html>2027: Deputy Speaker, Kalu joins call for Gov Otti to join APC</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bruxelles-accorde-une-subvention-de-356-millions-deuros-aux-victimes-de-xynthia.html>Bruxelles accorde une subvention de 35,6 millions d'euros aux victimes de Xynthia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./prise-en-compte-de-la-penibilite-dans-la-fonction-publique-large-desaccord-entre-le-gouvernement-et.html>dsaccord sur les dparts anticips des fonctionnaires</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./events.html>Historical Events in April 1920</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1258549-nicole-kidman-bio-age-height-husband-children-net-worth-html.html>Nicole Kidman bio: age, height, husband, children, net worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVlog.
