Crews appeared on the latest episode of the hit show that helps celebrities learn about their family’s history. The America’s Got Talent judge was emotional as he learned about the similarities that he and his ancestors shared.</strong></p><p>Crews was all smiles as host Henry Louis Gates, Jr. went through the star’s family history. Crews spoke to Gates about his grandmother raising him. His mother was more of a sister because she had Crews at a young age. The actor learned that just as he was raised by his grandmother, she was raised by her grandfather.</p><p>The Brooklyn 911 star has spoken candidly about his turbulent youth. It was his grandmother’s love that Crews remembers being a bright spot in his life. His curiosity then led to pure joy when he learned about what he had in common with his great-grandfather.</p><p>Crews learned that he inherited his entrepreneurial spirit from his ancestor. His great-grandfather was a businessman with many jobs. It is not hard to believe that hard work runs through Crews’s DNA. The entertainer has been in the industry for almost 25 years.</p><p>Since entering the entertainment industry Crews’s career continues to rise. Now more than ever he has continued that “hustler” mentality. He acts, produces, and has hosted multiple talent shows, including the upcoming season of <a href=#>America’s Got Talent: Extreme</a>. The White Chicks actor even has his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CZxZq1igaVc/</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-terry-crews-discovers-family-roots>Terry Crews Discovers Family Roots</h2><p>Crews learned of a group of his ancestors being torn a part during slavery. The story hit too close to home for the father of five. Crews’s mind started to race thinking about the generational affects the incident has had on his family. He showed how grateful he was to have his kids and his family together.</p><p>Crews has never shied away from being the ultimate family man. He celebrated his 32nd wedding anniversary with his wife recently. He has also been active in his children’s life and can be seen supporting their dreams. Crews’s son Isiah has been working to break into music as well as Hollywood.</p><p>Crews said he is now inspired to make a movie about his family’s history.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1350351870.jpg alt="Talent Show Judges Who Should Perform at the Super Bowl Halftime Show" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>terry crews</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57056pq7FdmL%2Bmw9Jmnqido2K8r3nAp2SepZ%2BptrC6wKVkq6ecobKzr86aqq2domK5pq3Rp6Cnn12Wr7DB02afoqtdp7ywwNJo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./internet-haut-debit-une-proposition-de-loi-pour-faire-participer-les-operateurs-au-financement.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>une proposition de loi pour faire participer les oprateurs au financement</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-watch-copa-america-final-online-1236068753.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Stream Copa Amrica Final 2024 Online: How to Watch Argentina vs. Colombia Without Cable</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2027-deputy-speaker-kalu-joins-call-for-gov-otti-to-join-apc.html>2027: Deputy Speaker, Kalu joins call for Gov Otti to join APC</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bruxelles-accorde-une-subvention-de-356-millions-deuros-aux-victimes-de-xynthia.html>Bruxelles accorde une subvention de 35,6 millions d'euros aux victimes de Xynthia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./prise-en-compte-de-la-penibilite-dans-la-fonction-publique-large-desaccord-entre-le-gouvernement-et.html>dsaccord sur les dparts anticips des fonctionnaires</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./events.html>Historical Events in April 1920</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1258549-nicole-kidman-bio-age-height-husband-children-net-worth-html.html>Nicole Kidman bio: age, height, husband, children, net worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVlog.
