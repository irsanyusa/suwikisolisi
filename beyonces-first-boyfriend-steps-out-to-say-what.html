She would say to me all the time, ‘I’m afraid to ever live my life without you <strong>Lyndall</strong>, I &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; want you to be mine for ever’. I’ll be honest — it was me that messed everything up and lost her for ever to Jay Z, but I deserved it. Who cheats on a woman as beautiful as &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beyonce? Well, I am that man and it’s something that’ll always haunt me</p><p><strong>How he met Beyonce:</strong></p><p>Met <strong>Beyonce</strong> through <strong>Kelly Rowland</strong> during a church youth group session when he was 13, and she was 11.From the first time I saw <strong>Beyonce</strong> I couldn't take my eyes off of &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; her. She looked like an angel, the most beautiful girl I’d ever seen. We’d hang out after school and almost every night we’d fall asleep talking to each other on the phone.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>On not knowing Beyonce could sing:</strong></p><p>She was just so shy, she was a bit of an outcast at school and didn't even sing in the choir. For two years I didn't know she could sing. We spent hours watching movies together &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and playing Connect 4.Some of our most fun times was when I watched Beyonce, her sister <strong>Solange</strong> and Kelly performing dance routines. So while I had no idea how good her &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; voice was back then, I certainly knew she could move.</p><p><strong>On their first kiss:</strong></p><p>It was just after <strong>Beyonce</strong>’s 15th birthday. I surprised her with <strong>Brian McKnight</strong> concert tickets and it happened that night. I had got popcorn and as we were sitting in our &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;seats I dropped it. As we both went down to grab it we bumped heads, and locked into our first kiss. We both just looked at each other realizing there was this incredible spark of &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;fireworks between us. It was that fairy tale kiss you only hear about in the movies. That was the first feeling of true love between me and <strong>Beyonce</strong>. Still, to this day, I've never &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; had another kiss as passionate as that one.</p><p>The bigger star she became, the more I didn't think I was good enough. One night, when she was out of town, I went to a bar with friends and ended up sleeping with another &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;woman. Over the course of a few years I cheated on her about five times, but I never told her until after we broke up.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>She was such a great girl who cared about me deeply, she even wrote her hit Dangerously in Love while we were together. That’s how in love we were back then. Initially my &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; intention was to take a break from our relationship so I could go to culinary school and make a name for myself. But when I headed to Austin to do the course she quickly moved &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on with her own life. Once she began dating <strong>Jay Z</strong>, I knew we were doomed and I could never win her back. But I know that no matter what, she will always love me. I will &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; always wonder ‘What if?’ and, given all we shared, I’m sure a part of her must feel the same way.</p><p>After reading this long note, what is his point actually? why talk now?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdktKq%2F02iZnrGfo7Cmv4yfoKurpGKvsMXFq6CeppRiwLWxz6xkqK2kYsGwedKasGavmJbBcLiYp6SeaGI%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./la-parole-est-vous-interview-de-christophe-bouniol-president-de-la-societe-thesee-datacenter.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>interview de Christophe Bouniol, prsident de la socit Thse DataCenter</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1465061-50-wishes-a-mum-celebrating-year-baby.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>50+ best wishes for a mum celebrating her one-year-old baby</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2027-deputy-speaker-kalu-joins-call-for-gov-otti-to-join-apc.html>2027: Deputy Speaker, Kalu joins call for Gov Otti to join APC</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bruxelles-accorde-une-subvention-de-356-millions-deuros-aux-victimes-de-xynthia.html>Bruxelles accorde une subvention de 35,6 millions d'euros aux victimes de Xynthia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./prise-en-compte-de-la-penibilite-dans-la-fonction-publique-large-desaccord-entre-le-gouvernement-et.html>dsaccord sur les dparts anticips des fonctionnaires</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./events.html>Historical Events in April 1920</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1258549-nicole-kidman-bio-age-height-husband-children-net-worth-html.html>Nicole Kidman bio: age, height, husband, children, net worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVlog.
