Her works have sold over 2&nbsp;billion copies, while Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple joined the company of&nbsp;the most recognizable fictional detectives. The life story of&nbsp;Agatha herself could’ve become the storyline of&nbsp;a&nbsp;novel or&nbsp;a&nbsp;movie: she started reading at&nbsp;4&nbsp;and writing at&nbsp;10, she wrote her first novel on&nbsp;a&nbsp;dare, learned to&nbsp;surf, and once mysteriously disappeared for 10&nbsp;days without a&nbsp;trace.</p><p>Here at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>, we&nbsp;are fans of&nbsp;the intriguing detective stories told by&nbsp;Agatha Christie, and we&nbsp;can’t wait to&nbsp;tell you her own story that seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;just as&nbsp;exciting as&nbsp;her work.</p><p><h2>She started to&nbsp;read at&nbsp;4, wrote her first poem at&nbsp;10, and spent her childhood playing alone with imaginary friends.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0fc/8dd/f74b345d0787971be1670491f7.jpg><p>Agatha Mary Clarissa Miller was <a href=#>born</a> on&nbsp;September&nbsp;15, 1890, and was the youngest of&nbsp;3&nbsp;children born to&nbsp;parents Frederick Alvah Miller and Clarissa Margaret Miller. Agatha had 2&nbsp;older siblings, her sister Margaret Frary, born in&nbsp;1879, and her brother Louis Montant, born in&nbsp;1880. The family mainly lived in&nbsp;Devon, England, but they traveled a&nbsp;lot and once spent a&nbsp;whole year traveling around France.</p><p>Agatha recollected that her mother Clara <a href=#>insisted</a> that she not go&nbsp;to&nbsp;school and instead be&nbsp;home-schooled. Clara also <strong>didn’t want Agatha learn to&nbsp;read until she was 8&nbsp;years old</strong>, but the curious girl was already reading by&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;4. Agatha’s sister and brother were much older than her, and she spent a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time in&nbsp;her <a href=# title=childhood data-link=tag>childhood</a> playing alone with her pets and imaginary friends. Agatha also enjoyed reading, and wrote her first poem, The Cowslip, at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;10.</p><p>In&nbsp;1901 Agatha’s father died, and the writer later confessed that this tragedy <a href=#>marked</a> the end of&nbsp;her childhood at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;11. In&nbsp;1905, Christie’s mother sent her to&nbsp;Paris where she studied in&nbsp;boarding schools and majored in&nbsp;playing piano and vocals.</p><p><h2>She wrote her first detective novel on&nbsp;a&nbsp;dare, challenged by&nbsp;her sister.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f8a/21f/db5d805ae89ab9eb0d44823668.jpg><p>Agatha Christie <a href=#>wrote</a> her first short story, The House of&nbsp;Beauty, when she was 18&nbsp;years old, and then continued writing a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;stories written under pseudonyms which included Mac Miller, Nathaniel Miller, and Sydney West. <strong>Many of&nbsp;the early works by&nbsp;Agatha Christie were rejected</strong>, including her first novel, Snow Upon the Desert, but Christie went on&nbsp;writing, inspired by&nbsp;the works of&nbsp;Wilkie Collins and Arthur Conan Doyle’s stories about Sherlock Holmes.</p><p>Christie <a href=#>wrote</a> her first detective novel, The Mysterious Affair at&nbsp;Styles, in&nbsp;1920 after her sister challenged her to&nbsp;write a&nbsp;detective story. This is&nbsp;the novel in&nbsp;which readers <a href=#>met</a> Hercule Poirot, Inspector Japp, and Artur Hastings for the first time, and in&nbsp;its own way, it&nbsp;marked the beginning of&nbsp;Christie’s successful writing career.</p><p><h2>She was married twice, learned how to&nbsp;surf with her first husband, and joined her second husband on&nbsp;archaeological expeditions.</h2></p><p class=adme-img-description>Agatha Christie and her husband Max Mallowan while visiting the Acropolis in&nbsp;Athens, 1958</p><p>Agatha <a href=#>met</a> her first husband, army officer Archibald Christie, at&nbsp;a&nbsp;dance in&nbsp;1912. The 2&nbsp;quickly fell in&nbsp;love and got married in&nbsp;1914&nbsp;on Christmas Eve. Agatha gave birth to&nbsp;her only child, Rosalind Margaret Clarissa, in&nbsp;1919. In&nbsp;1922 the couple left Rosalind with Agatha’s mother and sister and went on&nbsp;a&nbsp;journey around the world during which they visited South Africa, Hawaii, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. During their trip they learned to&nbsp;surf and they even “<a href=#>were</a> among <strong>the first Britons to&nbsp;surf standing&nbsp;up</strong>” in&nbsp;Waikiki.</p><p>In&nbsp;1928 Agatha and Archibald got <a href=#>divorced</a>, and he&nbsp;married another woman a&nbsp;week later. Christie kept her surname for her writing career. In&nbsp;1930 she went on&nbsp;a&nbsp;trip to&nbsp;Baghdad, Iraq, where she first met her second husband, archeologist Max Mallowan. Together Agatha and Max went on&nbsp;his archaeological expeditions, and those journeys inspired several of&nbsp;her novels that were set in&nbsp;the Middle East. The 2&nbsp;were married until Christie died in&nbsp;1976.</p><p><h2>She once disappeared for 10&nbsp;days and was nowhere to&nbsp;be&nbsp;found.</h2></p><p class=adme-img-description>Agatha and her daughter Rosalind (right) in&nbsp;a&nbsp;newspaper article that reported Agatha missing, 1926</p><p>On&nbsp;December&nbsp;3, 1926 Agatha <a href=#>disappeared</a> from her home after a&nbsp;quarrel with her first husband, Archibald. Earlier that year, he&nbsp;asked Agatha for a&nbsp;divorce&nbsp;— he&nbsp;had fallen in&nbsp;love with another woman. The morning after the mysterious disappearance, Agatha’s car was found next to&nbsp;a&nbsp;chalk quarry with an&nbsp;expired driver’s license and some clothes inside.</p><p>The case instantly made headlines, and newspapers <a href=#>offered</a> rewards for any information about the novelist. Christi’s disappearance was reported in&nbsp;The New York Times, and she was searched for by&nbsp;police and thousands of&nbsp;volunteers. On&nbsp;December&nbsp;14, 1926, she was found at&nbsp;the Swan Hydropathic Hotel in&nbsp;Yorkshire, England. When getting registered at&nbsp;the hotel, <strong>she used the name of&nbsp;her husband’s lover&nbsp;— Mrs. Tressa Neele</strong>.</p><p>There are different opinions on&nbsp;why Agatha disappeared, some <a href=#>suggest</a> the reason for her actions was a&nbsp;nervous breakdown, while others believe she did it&nbsp;to&nbsp;embarrass her husband and didn’t expect that it&nbsp;would turn into a&nbsp;public drama.</p><p><h2>She left&nbsp;us with 66&nbsp;detective novels, 14&nbsp;short-story collections, and a&nbsp;vacation house we&nbsp;can rent.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/922/621/cd0ab55a5ba637d5879486de70.jpg><p>Agatha Christie <a href=#>died</a> on&nbsp;January&nbsp;12, 1976, at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;85.

Her novels And Then There Were None and Murder on&nbsp;the Orient Express became timeless classics, and her play The Mousetrap, which was first staged in&nbsp;1952, was still performed as&nbsp;of&nbsp;December 2019.</p><p>If&nbsp;you are a&nbsp;devoted and passionate fan of&nbsp;Agatha’s writing, you can <a href=#>rent</a> her former holiday home in&nbsp;Devon, where you can get even closer to&nbsp;the life and art of&nbsp;the world-famous writer, while sitting in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;her chairs with her book in&nbsp;your hands.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you like Agatha Christie’s work?
