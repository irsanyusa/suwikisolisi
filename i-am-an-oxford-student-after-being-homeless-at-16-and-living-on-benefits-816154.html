She now has a&nbsp;life that has taken a&nbsp;surreal turn. The young lady has been accepted into Oxford University, and now she shares her story, that made thousands of&nbsp;people believe that true miracles happen after hard times.</p><p><h2>Chloe’s life wasn’t a&nbsp;bed of&nbsp;roses at&nbsp;all.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4e4/af9/3309b15034ad708f4722e51063.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Chloe Pomfret</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;young lady, who’s only 20&nbsp;years old, but she’s been through so&nbsp;many troubles and pain in&nbsp;her life already, that it’s hard to&nbsp;believe how she managed to&nbsp;survive. A&nbsp;young woman used to&nbsp;walk the streets of&nbsp;Manchester, being a&nbsp;homeless teenager. She grew up&nbsp;in&nbsp;foster care when she was a&nbsp;child after she became estranged from her family when her granddad died.</p><p>Chloe was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>separated</a> from her parents and siblings at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;5, and now she does not wish to&nbsp;name her relatives in&nbsp;her interviews. The girl only mentions that being taken away from her parents and her siblings was a&nbsp;very traumatic process, but it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;necessity at&nbsp;that time, as&nbsp;her mom and dad had bad habits that prevented them from caring for their children.</p><p><h2>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;teenager, Chloe experienced the darkest side of&nbsp;life.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c66/30b/fd473253178e36e6c0ed2d6e34.jpg><p>By&nbsp;the time of&nbsp;her teenage years, Chloe hadn’t seen much happiness in&nbsp;her life. She spent <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>3&nbsp;months</a> sofa surfing and was literally living on&nbsp;the streets. This all happened when she was just&nbsp;16, and it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;time when she had the darkest thoughts in&nbsp;her mind.</p><p>Describing her hopelessness, Chloe said that she was absolutely desperate and felt she had “nowhere to&nbsp;turn”. But her school luckily helped her with accommodation and the girl decided to&nbsp;dedicate all her time and effort to&nbsp;her further education and had a&nbsp;sacred dream of&nbsp;becoming a&nbsp;biology teacher.</p><p><h2>Chloe didn’t believe in&nbsp;wonders, and worked hard.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7bf/1a1/293da856509a893bb691f0a426.jpg><p>Chloe was a&nbsp;typical hard worker at&nbsp;that time, studying to&nbsp;pursue her career goals in&nbsp;the future. Applying to&nbsp;Oxford University was not on&nbsp;the girl’s radar, but one day Chloe <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>discovered</a> the Human Sciences course at&nbsp;Oxford. This was literally everything she had ever dreamed&nbsp;of.</p><p>So, full of&nbsp;hopes, she decided to&nbsp;submit an&nbsp;application. At&nbsp;that point, Chloe’s term of&nbsp;supported <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>accommodation</a> was coming to&nbsp;an&nbsp;end and if&nbsp;she couldn’t have another place to&nbsp;live, she would become homeless again. And much to&nbsp;her surprise, Chloe was offered a&nbsp;university place during this time and just as&nbsp;she got the news, the young woman shared her story, saying, “Benefits girl is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;Oxford.”</p><p><h2>Now Chloe is&nbsp;living her dream life, and inspires others.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cfe/7d7/dc48ce5c85ab35e79fe1fc911f.jpg><p>Now, the young lady is&nbsp;happily <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>leaving</a> behind the years she spent in&nbsp;foster care and becoming estranged and homeless. Chloe has already spent her first year at&nbsp;the prestigious university, but her mission there hasn’t been only studying. Chloe, being a&nbsp;live example, is&nbsp;changing the university policy with only one aim. She wants to&nbsp;help support students like herself, giving equal opportunities to&nbsp;everyone and inspiring people to&nbsp;pursue their dreams whatever happens.</p><p>Chloe confessed that for her, it&nbsp;still feels surreal when she walks out into Oxford. She admires all big, fancy buildings, and for the girl it’s just a&nbsp;whole other world. It’s a&nbsp;big surprise for her to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;formals, where they’re serving her food, and she has a&nbsp;cleaner that comes and cleans her room, and the only thought that comes to&nbsp;her mind at&nbsp;this sight&nbsp;is, “What on&nbsp;Earth?”.</p><p>The young lady feels extremely grateful that she’s had the support to&nbsp;get to&nbsp;where she’s now. She feels absolutely lucky because she realizes that other students in&nbsp;her situation probably wouldn’t have had this.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a82/760/422f3d5591a9e21bee10ddf2c3.jpg><p>Chloe was the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>co-member</a> for Class Act, an&nbsp;organization at&nbsp;Oxford, that supports estranged students and students from working class backgrounds. The lady wants to&nbsp;continue helping people who have the similar backgrounds, and feels lucky to&nbsp;have overcome all the challenges she has faced.</p><p>She considers her life before Oxford a&nbsp;horrible experience, but surprisingly she wouldn’t want to&nbsp;change a&nbsp;thing. The girl believes she had learned much from&nbsp;it, as&nbsp;being estranged taught her to&nbsp;be&nbsp;resilient, independent and use her journey to&nbsp;help people.</p><p>And here’s yet another inspirational story about a&nbsp;girl who became a&nbsp;<a href=#>mom at&nbsp;14</a>, but never gave up&nbsp;and inspired many women with her example.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZurcxmmKdln62zsL7DZqqtrZSau7V5wJ%2Brnqpdl7KqusZmn6illaGytL%2BMmqtmaWZirq%2BwjKWgr6GenHqwuoybnKedlp7BtHmXam1qbWRk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mix-up-mix-up-bob-marley.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mix up Mix up Bob Marley</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-taofik-kolade-went-from-being-an-assistant-to-writing-for-two-popular-american-tv.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Taofik Kolade went from being an assistant to writing for two popular American TV shows 'Atlanta</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2027-deputy-speaker-kalu-joins-call-for-gov-otti-to-join-apc.html>2027: Deputy Speaker, Kalu joins call for Gov Otti to join APC</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bruxelles-accorde-une-subvention-de-356-millions-deuros-aux-victimes-de-xynthia.html>Bruxelles accorde une subvention de 35,6 millions d'euros aux victimes de Xynthia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./prise-en-compte-de-la-penibilite-dans-la-fonction-publique-large-desaccord-entre-le-gouvernement-et.html>dsaccord sur les dparts anticips des fonctionnaires</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./events.html>Historical Events in April 1920</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1258549-nicole-kidman-bio-age-height-husband-children-net-worth-html.html>Nicole Kidman bio: age, height, husband, children, net worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVlog.
