There are few standard shapes for sectionals, like U-and L-shaped, but most manufacturers offer a wide variety of sizes and styles and fabrics that allow you to customize your perfect sectional. A practical piece of furniture, some sectionals are roomy, others are more structured, and you can often make them as “big” or “small” as needed for your space.</p><h2 id=how-to-choose-the-best-sectional-sofa-for-you>How to choose the best sectional sofa for you</h2><p>The best sectional sofa for your space depends on the room size, sectional size, fabric, and how you need the sectional to function. If you're buying one to snuggle with your kids and pets, a sectional with easy-to-clean fabric and deep seats for extra coziness might be your best bet. If your sectional is in a guest room, you may want to purchase one with a convertible sleeper option.</p><p>Because you build your own sectional using different components—like a loveseat or chaise lounge-like chair—and even add-in features like blanket storage, cup holders, and even Bluetooth speakers—your budget will likely play a role in the type of sectional you purchase. You can find affordable, great-quality pieces for under $1,000, but you will have to shop around, and it may be wise to look for sales.</p><p>The upside to having so many sectional choices out there is that there are plenty available at multiple prices, colors, sizes and styles for you to start designing the sectional of your dreams.</p><h2 id=top-sectional-sofa-picks>Top sectional sofa picks</h2><h3>Best sectional sofa for small spaces: <a rel=nofollow href=#>AllModern’s Geo 2-Piece Upholstered Sectional</a></h3><p>If you have a small space or only need comfortable seating for two, this sectional should do the trick.

Design, price points, and comfort each played a role in our decisions, and the author herself sat on several sectionals to influence some of the final choices as well.</p><h2 id=what-is-the-most-popular-sectional-sofa-design>What is the most popular sectional sofa design?</h2><p>An L-shaped sectional sofa with a chaise design is a popular choice for consumers mainly because it can usually fit in a small or large room and is easy to add pieces. Jennifer Parsons, interior designer and principal of <a rel=nofollow href=#>Context Design</a> in Brooklyn, New York, shares that her go-to for solid, yet budget sectionals are Burrow and Ikea, which offer affordable, great pieces.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=what-is-the-standard-size-of-a-sectional-sofa>What is the standard size of a sectional sofa?</h2><p>Sectionals can be many sizes depending on the furniture maker and how the sectional is built. Lengthwise, it could be anywhere from 103” to 130” inches or longer, but this is just an estimate. For example, a three-seat sectional with a chaise could be 103.25” long.</p><h2 id=how-tall-should-your-sofa-be>How tall should your sofa be?</h2><p>The standard height of a sofa is between 30 to 36 inches, although a custom-designed and built sofa or sectional could vary in size (taller or shorter) depending on the size ordered.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>What is the best time of year to buy a sectional sofa?</h3><p>The best time of year to buy a sectional sofa is usually during holidays like Memorial Day and Labor Day. It’s worth checking Black Friday sales as well.</p><h3>How do you know if a sectional is of good quality?</h3><p>A good quality sectional will not sag or rip easily, and often custom-made sectionals, like most furniture, are often of higher quality than those made in a large factory. A sturdy frame and a strong interlocking system are also signs of a high-quality product.</p><h3>What is the average lifespan of a sectional sofa?</h3><p>The average lifespan of a sectional sofa depends on the care and maintenance you give it. A sectional sofa could last 10 years or more if you buy a high-quality product and treat it well.</p><h3>How much should a quality sectional sofa cost?</h3><p>Parsons says there is a huge range in quality sofas from Ikea and Burrow (anywhere from $1500 to $3500) to really high-end pieces from Serena & Lily and George Smith. A quality sofa doesn’t have to be super expensive if you shop around.</p><h3>Do sectionals make a room look small?</h3><p>Not necessarily, shares Parsons, who has done interior design work for clients living in both large and small spaces. “It would, of course, depend on the room, but counterintuitively, rooms look smaller [when it is] empty! You want the furniture scale to be appropriate and work for the layout and sometimes sectionals are the most efficient use of space and maximize seating,” she says.</p><h3>What is the best material for a sectional sofa?</h3><p>You should look for materials that can easily be cleaned, especially if you have young children and/or pets. “Most companies offer high-performance velvets or other fabrics that are stain and snag resistant,” recommends Parsons .”If your budget allows, I think leather is fabulous.”</p><h3>What Is the best color for a sectional sofa?</h3><p>The best color of a sectional sofa really depends on a few factors, like the color of the room itself. Some popular colors that make good foundations for room palettes are neutral-based. “A sectional is a BIG piece, so light and neutral is safe—whereas, with a standard sofa and accent chairs, I might go bolder with a pattern or the rich green, blue or pink—you can always add color and flair with beautiful rugs, curtains, throws, and pillows,” says Parsons.</p><h3>Where should you place a sectional sofa in your living room?</h3><p>It depends on many factors, space of the room, the size of the sectional, and what other pieces of furniture are in the room. Two suggestions: A sectional could divide a large room or act as focal-point seating in front of a fireplace or television.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lo5qwtbXOp5ilZaOks6K%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ce-que-prevoit-lavant-projet-de-loi-cadre.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ce que prvoit l'avant-projet de loi cadre</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-unspeakable-act-1200506773.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Unspeakable Act</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2027-deputy-speaker-kalu-joins-call-for-gov-otti-to-join-apc.html>2027: Deputy Speaker, Kalu joins call for Gov Otti to join APC</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bruxelles-accorde-une-subvention-de-356-millions-deuros-aux-victimes-de-xynthia.html>Bruxelles accorde une subvention de 35,6 millions d'euros aux victimes de Xynthia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./prise-en-compte-de-la-penibilite-dans-la-fonction-publique-large-desaccord-entre-le-gouvernement-et.html>dsaccord sur les dparts anticips des fonctionnaires</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./events.html>Historical Events in April 1920</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1258549-nicole-kidman-bio-age-height-husband-children-net-worth-html.html>Nicole Kidman bio: age, height, husband, children, net worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVlog.
