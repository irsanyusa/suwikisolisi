But there’s one city that the pop star has referenced time and time again across her discography. The first noteworthy time Swift<strong>—</strong><a href=#><strong>TIME’s 2023 Person of the Year</strong></a><strong>—</strong>mentioned London in her music was back in 2012, when she released the song “Come Back… Be Here” on the deluxe version of her album Red. The song recounts the musician’s struggles dating someone who is frequently jet setting around the world, including London.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But it was just the beginning of Swift’s appreciation of the city. In late 2016, she reportedly began dating actor Joe Alwyn, who grew up in North London. Their relationship, which would go on to span six years, is believed to have inspired several songs across her discography and is widely considered to be the basis of her seventh studio album, Lover.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As the Eras Tour finally lands in London, here’s your very own Swift x London tour guide, highlighting the spots mentioned across her catalog of music.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>North London</strong></h2><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Highgate</strong></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The highgate neighborhood is a residential area in north London. In the song “London Boy,” Swift says her lover, presumed to be Alwyn, took her “back to Highgate” and introduced her to his friends.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In Victorian times, <a href=#>Highgate was known as a distinct village</a> separate from London, but in modern times as the city has grown, the location has become encompassed into the metropolitan area. It is perhaps best known for Highgate village, a collection of Georgian shops and pubs. The village is located at the top of Highgate Hill, and provides picturesque views of central London. The neighborhood is also home to the Victorian Highgate Cemetery, where notable figures from history and literature like philosopher Karl Marx and novelist George Elliot are buried.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Hampstead Heath&nbsp;</strong></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Hampstead Heath, referred to as “the Heath” in Swift’s music, is among the largest parks in London, <a href=#>sprawling across over 800 acres</a>. It includes several large hills and views of the London skyline. Beyond its mention in Swift’s songs “London Boy” and “So Long, London,” it has also played a prominent role in many famous works of popular culture. Bram Stoker’s novel Dracula is partially set in Hampstead Heath and the area was featured prominently in the 2017 film Hampstead, starring Diane Keaton and Brendan Gleeson.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Camden Market</strong></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Camden Market is mentioned in the lyrics to the song “London Boy,” when Swift sings about enjoying “walking Camden Market in the afternoon.” The area, known for being a tourist hot spot, is composed of six separate smaller markets and has stands that sell clothing, crafts, and various delicacies. The market is officially open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., local time, seven days a week, with the weekends being the busiest time, but some brick and mortar stores in the area may be open later.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The surrounding neighborhood of Camden Town is also known for its rock music scene and vintage clothing markets. The neighborhood features an iconic statue of the late British singer <a href=#>Amy Winehouse</a>, who famously frequented the area.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>West London</strong></h2><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>The West End</strong></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The West End is also mentioned in “London Boy,” as Swift sings “I love high tea, stories from uni, and the West End.”<strong> </strong>It is one of London’s most famous areas, and is especially known for its theater scene and entertainment venues.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For musical theater fans, top musicals put on shows in the area most nights a week. Tourists can also stop to see prominent art exhibitions at the National Gallery and The Royal Academy of Arts.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Swift visited the West End as recently as June 2024, when she attended the show Cabaret starring her friend Cara Delevingne at a theater called Kit Kat Club, <a href=#>according to ELLE magazine</a>.<strong> </strong>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Louis V on Bond Street</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/LouisVBondStreet.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In one of Swift’s most specific lyrics in “London Boy,” she refers to a famous Louis Vuitton store on Bond Street—home to many luxury stores in central London. She tells her lover, presumed to be Alwyn, that the place he takes her to doesn’t have to be “Louis V on Bond Street” to emphasize that luxury is not important to her. The street is actually considered part of the West End, so Swift fans can visit two places from her song at the same time.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>South London</strong></h2><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>The Black Dog</strong></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Black Dog is a pub in Vauxhall, an area which is also home to TIME’s London workspace. The pub is mentioned in Swift’s song “The Black Dog” on her most recent album, <a href=#>The Tortured Poet’s Department.</a> The phrase “the black dog” is <a href=#>a euphemism for depression</a>. In the song, Swift sings about a former partner who shared his location with the pop star on his phone. After the break up, he forgot to turn off the location sharing feature on his phone, allowing Swift to watch him walk into The Black Dog pub.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Brixton</strong></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The south London neighborhood of Brixton, which Swift mentions in her song “London Boy,” is known for musical heritage. When mentioning the area, Swift sings that she enjoys “nights in Brixton, Shoreditch in the afternoon.” Brixton has a large Afro-Caribbean population and is also <a href=#>considered to be the home of the U.K. 's drill music</a>, a subgenre of gangsta rap music.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Visitors to Brixton may also want to check out Brixton Market and the birthplace of pop icon David Bowie, who was born and raised in Brixton.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>East</strong> <strong>London</strong></h2><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Hackney</strong></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Hackney is a neighborhood in the northeast area of London and is home to the famous London Fields park. Swift mentions the neighborhood in “London Boy” as an alternative to the fancier parts of London like Bond Street, singing: “So please show me Hackney, doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street, just wanna be with you.” Hackney has lots of vibrant street art and is also home to the <a href=#>Hackney Museum</a>, which explores the history of immigration in the city.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Shoreditch</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Shoreditch.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Shoreditch is a trendy neighborhood in east London, where visitors can enjoy lots of vintage shops, street art, and local music. Swift mentions that she loved visiting the neighborhood in the afternoons in “London Boy,” but the area is vibrant throughout the evenings as well, especially on the weekends. Visitors may want to check out the nearby Brick Lane and <a href=#>Boxpark</a>, which have lots of dining and shopping options.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcWllfniFjq2YsqSfp3q0w8ifq2akn6OxsLqMpaacmaSevK%2B%2FjKCsopyVZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-grapes-of-wrath-1939-by-john-steinbeck.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>All-TIME 100 Novels</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-shopping-is-addictive.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why Shopping Is AddictiveEspecially for Stuff We Don't Need</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2027-deputy-speaker-kalu-joins-call-for-gov-otti-to-join-apc.html>2027: Deputy Speaker, Kalu joins call for Gov Otti to join APC</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bruxelles-accorde-une-subvention-de-356-millions-deuros-aux-victimes-de-xynthia.html>Bruxelles accorde une subvention de 35,6 millions d'euros aux victimes de Xynthia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./prise-en-compte-de-la-penibilite-dans-la-fonction-publique-large-desaccord-entre-le-gouvernement-et.html>dsaccord sur les dparts anticips des fonctionnaires</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./events.html>Historical Events in April 1920</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1258549-nicole-kidman-bio-age-height-husband-children-net-worth-html.html>Nicole Kidman bio: age, height, husband, children, net worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVlog.
