The show was a&nbsp;huge success. It&nbsp;<a href=#>got</a> several meaningful television awards, including an&nbsp;Emmy and a&nbsp;Grammy, and was nominated for a&nbsp;Golden Globe. Years after the show was over, Frankie made headlines when he&nbsp;confessed he&nbsp;didn’t actually remember much about taking part in&nbsp;the sitcom that made him so&nbsp;famous.</p><p>The story of&nbsp;Frankie Muniz amazed&nbsp;us here at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>, and we&nbsp;believe it&nbsp;can inspire many people with health disorders to&nbsp;live their lives as&nbsp;fully as&nbsp;they can.</p><p><h2>Malcolm in&nbsp;the Middle made Frankie Muniz a&nbsp;star, but he&nbsp;can’t remember taking part in&nbsp;the show.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a2b/c6c/0fd89e5291a43b15990d83d9a4.jpg><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;interviews back in&nbsp;2017 Frankie Muniz, now&nbsp;33, candidly <a href=#>told</a> the world he&nbsp;had been struggling with a&nbsp;significant memory loss that made him forget a&nbsp;huge part of&nbsp;his life. Strange as&nbsp;it&nbsp;may seem, the actor who became so&nbsp;popular thanks to&nbsp;Malcolm in&nbsp;the Middle doesn’t remember much about taking part in&nbsp;it, and barely recognizes himself when he&nbsp;re-watches the episodes now.</p><p>“Most people would think that my&nbsp;most memorable year would be&nbsp;the year Malcolm in&nbsp;the Middle started, because it&nbsp;allowed me&nbsp;to&nbsp;live all these dreams of&nbsp;mine.<strong> But the truth&nbsp;is, I&nbsp;don’t really remember much of&nbsp;that. It&nbsp;almost feels like it&nbsp;wasn’t me</strong>,” <a href=#>says</a> the actor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8ed/ebf/cd2e19545a874bae6eb3b3a21f.jpg><p>It&nbsp;turns out that Frankie can’t remember taking part in&nbsp;the Emmy Awards ceremony in&nbsp;2001&nbsp;either. “To&nbsp;be&nbsp;honest, <strong>I&nbsp;don’t remember going to&nbsp;the Emmys when&nbsp;I was nominated</strong>. I&nbsp;don’t specifically remember being nominated, or&nbsp;what I&nbsp;felt, or&nbsp;what we&nbsp;did. My&nbsp;mom told me&nbsp;we&nbsp;went to&nbsp;the dentist that day,” Frankie <a href=#>says</a>. He&nbsp;<a href=#>adds</a> that over the past decades his mom would reminisce about some memorable events of&nbsp;his life, but they all sounded like new stories to&nbsp;the actor.</p><p><h2>What is&nbsp;it&nbsp;that is&nbsp;making Frankie forget the most meaningful episodes of&nbsp;his life?</h2></p><p>Frankie <a href=#>says</a>, when he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;kid he&nbsp;didn’t think he&nbsp;was not&nbsp;OK or&nbsp;that something wrong was happening with his memory. It&nbsp;seemed to&nbsp;him that it&nbsp;was pretty normal and that <strong>he&nbsp;wasn’t supposed to&nbsp;remember things</strong>. The reason for the actor’s severe memory loss still remains unclear, but he&nbsp;<a href=#>confessed</a> that during his life, he’s had several concussions and a&nbsp;number of&nbsp;transient ischemic attacks, or&nbsp;mini-strokes, which means his brain was cut off from its blood supply for a&nbsp;short time during these episodes.</p><p><h2>Frankie left his acting career for a&nbsp;while, but he’s enjoying his life to&nbsp;the fullest.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4ed/6b4/996398505faf649e8633cd5824.jpg><p>Frankie Muniz doesn’t let the disorder interfere with his plans and he&nbsp;is&nbsp;living a&nbsp;life full of&nbsp;adventure. He&nbsp;takes part in&nbsp;TV shows, including Dancing with the Stars, and he’s also a&nbsp;professional car racer. The actor doesn’t like to&nbsp;discuss his memory loss, and he&nbsp;only speaks about it&nbsp;when he’s asked direct questions. Frankie is&nbsp;optimistic and he&nbsp;doesn’t want people to&nbsp;feel sorry for him. After all, he&nbsp;<a href=#>doesn’t</a> feel sick.</p><p>“This is&nbsp;my&nbsp;life and I’ve moved forward. <strong>It&nbsp;doesn’t stop me&nbsp;from being anywhere&nbsp;I want to&nbsp;be</strong>. I’m only reminded of&nbsp;how bad my&nbsp;memory is&nbsp;when people I&nbsp;see, they come to&nbsp;me&nbsp;and&nbsp;go, ‘Oh, you remember when we&nbsp;did this?’ And I&nbsp;have no&nbsp;recollection of&nbsp;it. But in&nbsp;my&nbsp;head, it’s not like&nbsp;I feel bad or&nbsp;sad about&nbsp;it,” Frankie <a href=#>says</a>.</p><p>The idea of&nbsp;losing his good memories is&nbsp;sad for Frankie, however. But this is&nbsp;when his beloved fiancée Paige comes to&nbsp;the rescue. Paige <strong><a href=#>keeps</a> a&nbsp;journal where she puts down all the memorable episodes of&nbsp;Frankie’s life</strong> that he&nbsp;loves to&nbsp;re-read so&nbsp;much. This journal is&nbsp;very helpful, and it&nbsp;lets Frankie recall the feelings and emotions he&nbsp;experienced at&nbsp;a&nbsp;particular moment. It’s something that pictures cannot&nbsp;do.</p><p>“She writes in&nbsp;a&nbsp;journal that&nbsp;I can look at&nbsp;every day and it’s really cool, because it&nbsp;has amazing detail. She started doing that about a&nbsp;year ago and hopefully she’ll continue. I&nbsp;hope we&nbsp;have a&nbsp;lot more memories together.”</p><p>Apart from traveling and car-racing, Frankie still enjoys acting and he&nbsp;<a href=#>hopes</a> to&nbsp;get back to&nbsp;his acting career in&nbsp;the near future. We&nbsp;believe that the story of&nbsp;Frankie and his memory loss once again proves that it’s important to&nbsp;keep your head held high no&nbsp;matter what happens and <strong>never let your disorder define you and keep you from moving forward</strong>.
