Coming with nine different attachments designed for everything from fine beard shaping to nose and ear hair removal, it’s a whole lot of bang for not very much buck.</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Functions: Hair, beard, nose, and ear trimmer</li><li>Trimming length settings: 7</li><li>Charge time: 8 hours</li><li>Runtime: 1 hour</li><li>Waterproof: No</li><li>Warranty: 2 years</li><li>Price on publish: $21.96</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Insanely inexpensive</li><li>Versatile</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Some customer reviews raise concerns about longevity</li></ul><h3>Best professional beard trimmer: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Bevel Pro All-In-One</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Bevel Pro All-In-One</h3></p><p>For a high-end, stylish-looking option, Bevel is a good place to start, in particular, their Pro All-In-One. From its magnetic, snap-lock guards to its easy-to-read LED display, it’s designed top to bottom to be easy to use without sacrificing quality or precision. And while it’s not suitable for longer beards, the fine control it offers for shorter styles (25 length settings, from 0 to 2.5mm in 0.1mm increments) is unmatched.</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Functions: Hair and beard trimmer</li><li>Trimming length settings: 25</li><li>Charge time: 2.6 hours</li><li>Runtime: 4 hours</li><li>Waterproof: No</li><li>Warranty: 1 year</li><li>Price on publish: $329.95</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Tons of control for shorter beard styles</li><li>Feels high-end</li><li>Easy to use</li></ul><h3 class=title>The bottom line:</h3><p>A pricey but gorgeous beard and hair trimmer for a professional experience at home.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Bevel Pro All-In-One</a></p><h3>Most reliable beard trimmer: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Panasonic Beard, Hair and Body Groomer ER-GB80-S</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Panasonic Beard, Hair and Body Groomer ER-GB80-S</h3></p><p>In terms of a beard trimmer that won’t let you down, Panasonic’s beard, hair, and body groomer is the one. I’ve been using this model for the last six years, and in all that time, it’s never had a single issue, whether I was trimming my stubble, doing some bodily weed-whacking, or even cutting my own hair during the pandemic. It’s also versatile and simple to use, allowing you to switch between face and bodyguards in seconds.</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Functions: Beard, hair, and body trimmer</li><li>Trimming length settings: 39</li><li>Charge time: 60 minutes</li><li>Runtime: 50 minutes</li><li>Waterproof: No</li><li>Warranty: 2 years</li><li>Price on publish: $84.99</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Durable</li><li>Charges quickly</li><li>Can be used while plugged in</li><li>Slide-up fine detailing trimmer</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>No charging stand</li></ul><h3>Best beard trimmer for thick or coarse hair: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Wahl Aqua Blade Deluxe</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Wahl Aqua Blade Deluxe</h3></p><p>As someone with pretty fine face and body hair, I find most trimmers do an okay job, but people with thicker or coarser hair need to be much more picky about their trimmers. Those seeking a more powerful model should check out Wahl’s Aqua Blade Deluxe, which has a reputation for slicing its way through hair like a hot knife through beard butter. For use on both face and body, as well as an included attachment for nose and ear hair, it’s capable of tackling whatever you’ve got.</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Functions: Beard, body, nose, and ear trimmer</li><li>Trimming length settings: 10</li><li>Charge time: 1 hour</li><li>Runtime: 2 hours</li><li>Waterproof: Yes</li><li>Warranty: 5 years</li><li>Price on publish: $69.99</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Powerful</li><li>Waterproof</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>A minority of customer reviews complain that the included guards feel a little flimsy</li></ul><h3>Best vacuum beard trimmer: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Remington Vacuum Beard & Stubble Trimmer 6000</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Remington Vacuum Beard & Stubble Trimmer 6000</h3></p><p>One thing I really don’t like about using a beard trimmer is the clean-up, trying to find and remove all those fiddly little bits of hair from all over the sink. To cut down this part of the process, consider a trimmer that holds onto the clippings. Banish all thoughts of the <a rel=nofollow href=#>Suck-Kut</a> from your head—Remington’s vacuum trimmer is designed for trimming, detailing, and edging, all while capturing 95% of the trimmed hairs. That definitely doesn’t suck.</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Functions: Beard and stubble trimmer</li><li>Trimming length settings: 13</li><li>Charge time: 2 hours</li><li>Runtime: 90 minutes</li><li>Waterproof: No</li><li>Warranty: 5 years</li><li>Price on publish: $59.99</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Reasonably priced</li><li>Captures 95% of trimmed hairs</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Not for longer beard styles</li></ul><h3>Best waterproof beard trimmer: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Braun Hair Clippers for Men 9-in-1</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Braun Hair Clippers for Men 9-in-1</h3></p><p>The alternative option for easier (or zero) clean-up is to trim your beard in the shower, for which you will, of course, need to buy something waterproof. While many models on this list will tolerate having their blades and guards rinsed off under running water, this is one of the few designed to be used safely in the shower, meaning all that trimmed hair flows neatly down the drain instead of all over your bathroom.</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Functions: Beard, body, nose, and ear trimmer</li><li>Trimming length settings: 13</li><li>Charge time: 60 minutes</li><li>Runtime: 100 minutes</li><li>Waterproof: Yes</li><li>Warranty: 2 years</li><li>Price on publish: $59.99</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Designed for use in the shower</li><li>Comes with a bonus Gillette Fusion5 ProGlide razor</li><li>Versatile</li><li>Reasonably priced</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Some customer reviews complain it’s less effective on thicker hair</li></ul><h3>Most versatile beard trimmer: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Braun All-in-One Series 9</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Braun All-in-One Series 9</h3></p><p>With 12 different accessories—including various detailing blades, a nose and ear trimmer, a body trimmer, and even a stencil for shaping your beard–Braun’s All-In-One Series 9 trimmer is the Swiss Army Knife of trimmers.

Why not both! Shaving with Philips Norelco’s OneBlade 360 is a similar experience to shaving with a high-end razor, with a head that swivels and flexes to match the contours of your face, as well as the option to use shaving foam or not. Clip on the adjustable comb, though, and you’ve got yourself a regular beard trimmer.

A modular set that allows you to switch between a trimmer, shaver, nose/ear trimmer, and a choice of two electric toothbrush heads, it all fits neatly into its accompanying water- and mold-resistant travel bag.</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Functions: Beard, nose, and ear trimmer, toothbrush</li><li>Trimming length settings: 58</li><li>Charge time: 1 hour</li><li>Runtime: 90 minutes</li><li>Waterproof: Yes</li><li>Warranty: 2 years</li><li>Price on publish: $136</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Versatile</li><li>Convenient</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>A small number of reviews claim that while it’s great as a trimmer, it’s less effective as a shaver</li></ul><h3>Best beard trimmer for quick fixes on the go: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Gillette Proglide Styler</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Gillette Proglide Styler</h3></p><p>For short trips like weekend breaks, when you won’t need to do much grooming beyond a quick touch-up here and there, you might want to take something smaller and not bring a whole kit with you. That’s what Gillette’s Proglide Styler is ideal for, being slim, compact, and easy to use. And, at less than $30, you won’t exactly be heartbroken if something happens to it on your trip.</p><h4 class=title>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Functions: Beard trimmer and shaver</li><li>Trimming length settings: 3</li><li>Charge time: N/A (it uses a single AA battery)</li><li>Runtime: N/A</li><li>Waterproof: Yes</li><li>Warranty: Not listed</li><li>Price on publish: $29.97</li></ul><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Compact</li><li>Fully waterproof</li><li>Blade head flips open for easier cleaning</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>No rechargeable battery</li></ul><h2 id=how-we-selected-the-best-beard-trimmers>How we selected the best beard trimmers</h2><p>Our selections were made through a mix of personal experience (I spent nearly seven years working in the men’s grooming category, so I know a thing or two about shaving and trimming facial hair!) and thorough research. I took extra care to comb through customer reviews for each of our suggestions to ensure that all of our picks scored highly for overall customer satisfaction.</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-before-buying-a-beard-trimmer>What to consider before buying a beard trimmer</h2><h3>Function</h3><p>Step one is to figure out what you’re going to use the trimmer for. Those looking for something to remove strays from their luxurious lumberjack beard will likely need more power and less finesse than someone who’s carefully shaping their Van Dyke. Those using it to shave off everything should decide if they want to do it at their sink or have the ability to shave in the shower (which, obviously, requires a waterproof trimmer). Also, is this just for your beard, or are you planning on using it elsewhere? Knowing the answer to these questions will quickly narrow down your options.</p><h3>Power source</h3><p>Are you okay with a wired trimmer, or do you like it to be more portable? If it uses a rechargeable battery, are you sure you have one that still works while plugged in? (Some don’t!) If you choose a wired one, but travel a lot, have you checked it will still work in other countries? Again, these are all important things to know before buying.</p><h3>Accessories</h3><p>Many trimmers come with a whole bundle of accessories, ranging from the standard (a brush for cleaning the trimmer head) to the more involved (multiple different heads for tackling, e.g., nose and eyebrow hair). Be sure you’re not paying for more than you actually need.</p><h2 id=maintenance-tips-for-beard-trimmers>Maintenance tips for beard trimmers</h2><h3>Clean</h3><p>“Clean your blade and trimmer regularly,” advises Wahl educator <a rel=nofollow href=#>Javy Andux</a>. “After every use, use the cleaning brush that comes with your trimmer to remove any hair buildup on the blade or under the blade.”</p><h3>Oil</h3><p>It’s also important to frequently oil your blades to keep them sharp and to prolong the blade life. To oil your blade, Andux recommends using the five-point oiling method: Apply three drops of oil across the teeth of the blade, then one drop on either side. Briefly turn the clipper on to disperse the oil, then wipe off any excess.</p><h3>Store</h3><p>“Properly store and handle your trimmer,” advises Anduz. “To prevent rusting, store your trimmer in a cool, dry place. When you notice your blades are pulling or not cutting like they used to, it’s time to replace your blade.”</p><h2 id=best-places-to-buy-a-beard-trimmer>Best places to buy a beard trimmer</h2><p>Beard trimmers can be bought at virtually any big box electronic store, large pharmacy, or online. Since you can’t test them out before buying, it’s a good idea to read reviews and compare prices first, so you have an idea of what you’re looking for and what you’ll expect to pay.</p><p>If you found this guide useful, be sure to also look at our guides to the <a rel=alternate href=#>best hair dryers</a> and the best hair clippers.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>What beard trimmer length should I use?</h3><p>“The ‘right’ length blade on your beard trimmer depends on your preferences,” says Anduz. “If you’re unsure of how long you want your beard, begin with the longest cutting guide–you can always cut more off with shorter cutting guides, but starting with the longest ensures you don’t groom your beard shorter than you prefer. If you want a close cut or details and fine lines, you can use shorter cutting guides or no guide at all.”</p><h3>How much should I spend on a beard trimmer?</h3><p>Beard trimmers run from as low as <span class="math math-inline"><span class=katex><span class=katex-mathml>20toover20 to over </span><span class=katex-html aria-hidden=true><span class=base><span class=strut></span><span class=mord>2</span><span class=mord>0</span><span class="mord mathnormal">t</span><span class="mord mathnormal">o</span><span class="mord mathnormal">o</span><span class="mord mathnormal">v</span><span class="mord mathnormal">e</span><span class="mord mathnormal">r</span></span></span></span></span>100, with some more professional-grade ones costing much more. The average trimmer for home use, though, generally runs somewhere around the <span class="math math-inline"><span class=katex><span class=katex-mathml>50−50 - </span><span class=katex-html aria-hidden=true><span class=base><span class=strut></span><span class=mord>5</span><span class=mord>0</span><span class=mord>−</span></span></span></span></span>90 range.</p><h3>How should you store a beard trimmer?</h3><p>“Professional barbers aim to get the most out of their clippers, from cut quality to longevity, so they store their clippers in cool, dry places,” says Anduz. “To get the same experience at home, we also recommend finding a cool, dry place to prevent rusting or damage.”</p><h3>How do you clean a beard trimmer?</h3><p>As explained in the maintenance section above, it’s important to clean and oil a beard trimmer after each use, and to store it away somewhere dry and cool.</p><h3>Is it better to groom your beard with a razor or a trimmer?</h3><p>If you’re talking about a literal beard, then a trimmer is going to be far more versatile and reliable than a standard razor, giving you a range of length and styling options. If you shave off all your stubble, it’s more down to personal preference, but anyone who suffers from razor burn should consider using a trimmer rather than wet shaving since wet shaving can cut hairs too close to the skin. This, in turn, can cause the hairs to curl under the skin, causing ingrown hairs and razor bumps.</p><p>The information presented here is created by TIME Stamped and overseen by TIME editorial staff.
