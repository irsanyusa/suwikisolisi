Here, he's playing a version of himself who is also the star of Thrones, but he's also extraordinarily rich, and not at all afraid to show it off. As Zach and his team show up to his house for the interview, Dinklage emerges at his front door in a bathrobe, shaking off a wild night that he'd had the night before. As he invites the public access TV crew into his lavish home, he also begins to show off some of his very expensive possessions: an Andy Warhol painting of La Croix, a copy of The Winds of Winter, George R. R. Martin's unreleased A Song of Ice and Fire novel, and not just a single Faberg egg, but a carton of Faberg Eggs.</p><p>Dinklage is presented as so richso rich!that when Zach and company steal his eggs, he chases after them briefly, and gives up before even leaving his driveway. He's that rich.</p><p>But it raises the question: Is he really that rich? Here's what we know about Dinklage's net worth.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-8cf3d8f4-7926-3046-a6c6-02206e5efba7 data-caption="peter dinklage between two ferns net worth game of thrones"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/1SjktktTURBXy82NWM2MTlhZi1iNzAxLTRhNDYtYjRjYy1mZjk2YWNhNjk3M2EucG5nkZUCzQMWzQG-wsM></span><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-7>Peter Dinklage's net worth is estimated to be around $25 million.</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Then there's the money he's made from blockbuster movies like X-Men: Days of Future Past (in which he played the movie's villain) and Avengers: Infinity War, in which he played a small role, but the movie itself was still massive. Dinklage's movie career is more expansive than you might think, actually. You probably remember Dinklage's turn in the holiday classic Elf as children's author Miles Finch, but what about his small role in the Oscar contender of a few years ago Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri? There's also his role in the poorly-received <a href=# id=a42d43ac-b78d-3989-adae-ee4e184f9dc9>Adam Sandler</a> movie Pixels, and his original breakout role in The Station Agent.</p><p>So, yes, his $25 million or so is a good chunk of change. Quite a lot indeed. But the Between Two Ferns riches that Dinklage showed off within the movie might not quite translate to reality. We'd be shocked if Dinklage didn't have some really cool Game of Thrones merch, but the full carton of Faberg eggs, well, that one was a solid gag for a funny movie.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLqmutJmn56ZnKm1cLzErZyrZZSeu6y4wKCcrGWemsFuw86rq6FlkZvBpr6MoJimnV2ks27Ax6ump52jYra0ecClpKirpGKutHnBop5mmaNir6bA1p6cp2WkrLxussSrpaxnlqF%2Ft37Ssw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rsa-plus-vite-ou-plus-loin.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>plus vite ou plus loin ?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./millennials-kill-american-cheese.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Millennials Kill Again.
