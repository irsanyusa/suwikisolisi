The longtime Dancing with the Stars couple officially tied the knot in an intimate Redwood Forest ceremony back in August.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-derek-hough-revisits-wedding-to-hayley-erbert>Derek Hough Revisits Wedding to Hayley Erbert</h2><p>During his recent appearance on The Jennifer Hudson Show, Hough took the time to share more details about his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wedding</a>. As expected, the special day involved numerous dance moves.</p><p>“It was so special. It was such a beautiful, beautiful weekend. It was magical,” he said.</p><p>Hough went on to reveal that the wedding kicked off with a “mosh pit.” The culprit? None other than DWTS pro <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Ballas</a>.</p><p>“My best man, Mark Ballas, did his best man speech and at the end of it, he was kind of recalling to when we were kids and we used to go to heavy metal and rock concerts,” he said. “And we started out with a big crowd surf to Korn — so that’s how it started.”</p><p>The DWTS judge went on to state that even his dad willingly joined the fun. According to the professional choreographer, his father was “break-dancing at one point,” taking him by surprise.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>“I’m like, ‘What are you doing over there?'” he said. “But it was a lot of fun — a lot of dancing, literally ‘til the end of the night. It was awesome.”</p><p>Of getting used to wearing his wedding ring, Hough stated he’s doing pretty much fine unless when he’s dancing. Nonetheless, the pro dancer admitted that having the ring’s presence “feels good.”</p><p>Hough and Erbert officially became husband and wife in Monterey County, California in front of 106 guests. The exravaganza began with a welcome party at a serene cliffside estate in Carmel, followed by a garden rehearsal dinner with family.</p><p>For their honeymoon, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">newlyweds explored Italy</a> and traveled to Lake Como, Tuscany, and Rome. Hough and Erbert shared this adventure on Instagram, posting clips that show them roaming around the place and jumping in the sea together.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-once-thought-his-friendship-with-jennifer-lopez-was-over>He Once Thought His Friendship with Jennifer Lopez was Over</h2><p>In the same interview, Hough also recalled one hilarious moment with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jennifer Lopez</a>. Apparently, there was a time he thought his friendship with the pop megastar ended because of a dance misstep.</p><p>“There was one time actually I went salsa dancing with Jennifer Lopez,” he said. “We’re dancing and we’re having a good night. We’re sweating, the live band’s playing. It’s steamy, it’s going great.”</p><p>Noting that the scene happened several years ago, he said that things went astray when he dipped Lopez and accidentally stepped on her hair. For his part, Hough said he had “no idea” of the situation until Lopez confronted her about it later on.</p><p>“She said, ‘Derek do you know what you did?’ I was like, ‘So you had the time of your life, what’s up?’ And she’s like, ‘No, you pulled out my hair!’ She has a chunk of it, and I’m like ‘I’m so sorry!'” he said. “And then the next day she was like ‘Hey, do you want to do a project with me?’ And I was like, ‘Fantastic, ’cause I thought our friendship was over.'”</p><p>Ahead of his judging stint on Dancing with the Stars, Hough assumed the same role alongside Lopez and Ne-Yo on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">World of Dance</a>. However, the choreographer and the pop star founded their friendship outside of the reality dance competition. Interestingly, he and Erbert used to double date with Lopez and her then-boyfriend Alex Rodriguez.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Original_PriyankaChopraJonas_Theo-WargoGetty-Images-for-Karl-Lagerfeld-220x147.jpeg alt="Priyanka Chopra Gets Candid About Motherhood: “It’s Extremely Scary”" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w56pnqNdnby2s8dmo6inm6h6o63CpGSopl2dtrR5zJqeopuRoXq4scOdoKefXam8brTAsqOesV2av6Ox0a1m</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./fishermen-dead-after-drinking-from-bottles-underwater.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fishermen dead after drinking from bottles underwater</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./april.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Happened on April 30, 1954</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2027-deputy-speaker-kalu-joins-call-for-gov-otti-to-join-apc.html>2027: Deputy Speaker, Kalu joins call for Gov Otti to join APC</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bruxelles-accorde-une-subvention-de-356-millions-deuros-aux-victimes-de-xynthia.html>Bruxelles accorde une subvention de 35,6 millions d'euros aux victimes de Xynthia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./prise-en-compte-de-la-penibilite-dans-la-fonction-publique-large-desaccord-entre-le-gouvernement-et.html>dsaccord sur les dparts anticips des fonctionnaires</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./events.html>Historical Events in April 1920</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1258549-nicole-kidman-bio-age-height-husband-children-net-worth-html.html>Nicole Kidman bio: age, height, husband, children, net worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVlog.
