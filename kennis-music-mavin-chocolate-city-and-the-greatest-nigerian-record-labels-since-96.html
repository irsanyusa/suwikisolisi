Some labels have performed on greater scales than others - some of these labels have also defined eras and created legacy that the sands of time will always reflect.</p><p>Without further ado, here are seven of the greatest Nigerian record labels since ‘99;</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-4>Kennis Music</h2></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Run: 1990 - 2015</strong></p><p><strong>Estimated number of albums: 75</strong></p><p><strong>Notable artists: 90% of the major movers in Nigerian music between 1995 and 2005</strong></p><p>At some point, <strong>Kennis Music </strong>was benefiting from the greatest controversies in history. <strong>Kennis Music </strong>signed <strong>The Remedies </strong>in the 90’s. When the group broke up and <strong>Tony Tetuila </strong>released his <strong>Paul Play</strong>-produced debut album, he was signed to <strong>Kennis Music.</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>When <strong>Eedris Abdulkareem </strong>released his consecutive 2002 albums, <strong>P.A.S.S </strong>and <strong>Mr Lecturer, </strong>he was in the thick of a beef with <strong>Tetuila. </strong>That beef had inspired those two albums. That year, <strong>Tetuila </strong>had also released his sophomore album, <strong>My Car.</strong></p><p>On the title track, he trolled and dissed <strong>Eedris Abdulkareem. </strong>All the while, they were on the same label - <strong>Kennis Music.</strong></p><p>The same thing happened with <strong>Blackface </strong>and <strong>Tuface Idibia. </strong>The ministry expanded into other acts including, <strong>Rasqie, Azadus Marvelous Benji, Maintain, Olu Maintain, Paul Play </strong>and so forth. In the late 2000s, the label then signed <strong>Blackface</strong>’s producer, <strong>Kelly Handsome </strong>while <strong>Abdulkareem </strong>made a comeback.</p><p>At some point in Nigeria, if Nigeria had a new star, you thought they were signed to <strong>Kennis. </strong>The last album released on the label was a <strong>Joe-EL Amadi </strong>album in 2015.</p><p>Founded by <strong>Kenny ‘Keke’ Ogungbe </strong>in the 90s, <strong>Dayo Adeneye </strong>came to be known as one of the duo behind the label. From radio, <strong>Kennis Music </strong>became minds behind a television station.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Till this day, no Nigerian label has <strong>Kennis Music</strong>'s catalogue of over 75 albums. What a label.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-16>Storm Records</h2></p><p><strong>Run: 1991 - 2013</strong></p><p><strong>Estimated number of albums: 30+</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Notable artists: Arguably Nigeria’s most influential record label between 2004 and 2008</strong></p><p>At some point, <strong>Storm Records </strong>had all of <strong>Jazzman Olofin, Sasha, Naeto C, Ikechukwu, GT The Guitarman, 2Shotz, General Pype, Darey Art Alade, Banky W </strong>and more were all the label at one point. By the time ‘Eko Ile’ dropped and it had just about everybody else, Nigeria had to accept the weird flex of that posse cut for what it was.</p><p>At the maiden <strong>MTV African Music Awards </strong>in 2008, <strong>Storm Records </strong>went home with three awards. The label also had a wild diversity of talent.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-23>YBNL</h2></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Run: 2011 -</strong></p><p><strong>Estimated number of albums: 16</strong></p><p><strong>Notable artists: Olamide, Lil Kesh, Adekunle Gold, Fireboy</strong></p><p>When <strong>Coded Tunes </strong>became a record label, <strong>Olamide </strong>was one of the three first set of artists signed to the label alongside <strong>Kayefi </strong>and <strong>Seriki. </strong>But <strong>Olamide</strong>’s stay with <strong>Coded Tunes </strong>only lasted for his debut album, <strong>Rapsodi.</strong></p><p>In 2011, his sophomore album, <strong>YBNL </strong>was released on his own record label, <strong>Yahoo Boy No Laptop </strong>- later simply known as <strong>YBNL Nation. </strong>By so doing, he became the first in his generation to float a label. Interestingly, he also founded what was going to be one of Nigeria’s most successful label runs ever.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>YBNL </strong>has created more than eight successful careers in the Nigerian music industry. It has also cemented <strong>Olamide </strong>as an amazing talent spotter, A&R, talent developer, nurturer and executive. Producers like <strong>Pheelz </strong>and <strong>Young Jonn </strong>have also gone on to have amazing careers after being affiliated with the label.</p><p>When everyone thought <strong>Olamide </strong>was done in 2018, he made all of <strong>Picazo Rhap, Limerick, Yomi Blaize, Lyta </strong>and <strong>Fireboy DML </strong>affiliated to the label. As <strong>Yomi Blaize </strong>rapped on ‘Juju, Guns and Roses’ to highlight what people thought of <strong>Olamide </strong>at the time, “ Olorun lo mo’bi ti Baddo ti ma n ri awon omode yi…”</p><p>In English, that captured all our sentiments. We all asked, “Where does <strong>Olamide </strong>get all these kids?’ While most of those youngsters have since left <strong>YBNL, Fireboy </strong>is currently one of Nigeria’s most bankable artists by any metric.</p><p>The only thing this label ever did wrong was miss that moment for a compilation album when <strong>Adekunle Gold, Lil Kesh, Viktoh, Chinko Ekun </strong>and more called <strong>YBNL </strong>‘home.’</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-34>Mo’Hits</h2></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-76cf64ad-6ee3-4e0d-8b1c-a1c4657ee7c4 data-caption="Don Jazzy and D'Banj.

Together, <strong>Don Jazzy </strong>and <strong>D’Banj </strong>left their sit in the US to come seek investment from <strong>D’Banj</strong>’s mother to float a label in Nigeria.</p><p><strong>D’Banj, </strong>who had been affiliated with <strong>JJC/419 </strong>squad also had a spell of being close to <strong>Durella. </strong>At the Independence Day Concert in 2004, <strong>D’Banj </strong>thrilled a UK audience and the label never stopped moving - it became a dynasty. Within one year of <strong>D’Banj</strong>’s reign, he won an <strong>MTV European Music Award.</strong></p><p>At the height of <strong>Mo’Hits, </strong>that label didn’t just underline power, it underlined modern superstardom. It went on to sign <strong>Dr. Sid, D’Prince, Wande Coal </strong>and <strong>Kay Switch. </strong>Three of those artists went on to become superstars and even <strong>KaySwitch </strong>had amazing moments. Their collaborative album, <strong>Curriculum Vitae </strong>could also be deemed a classic.</p><p>While a part of the label went on to become <strong>MAVIN Records - </strong>which is currently Nigeria’s leading record label by brand equity and corporate influence - the story of <strong>Mo’Hits Records </strong>is still associated with what could have been.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-45>Chocolate City</h2></p><p><strong>Run: 2006 - 2012</strong></p><p><strong>Estimated number of albums: 25+</strong></p><p><strong>Notable artists: MI Abaga, Ice Prince, Jesse Jagz</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>In 2006, <strong>Chocolate City </strong>signed <strong>Jeremiah Gyang </strong>as its first artist with earnings from <strong>Audu Maikori</strong>’s monthly income as a Lawyer. What began as a nightclub, then a creative hub hit the goldmine when it allowed a certain <strong>MI Abaga </strong>sign on without an advance in 2007. He also came with his brothers, <strong>Jesse Jagz </strong>and <strong>Ice Prince.</strong></p><p>Later, they were joined by <strong>Brymo </strong>and established the ‘Choc Boiz’ collective that was the envy of all and cynosure of all eyes in Nigerian music circa late-2010s. They merged the swagger of Hip-Hop with the grand delivery of Afro-pop and created a successful template that everybody wanted to jump up.</p><p><strong>MI Abaga </strong>went on to release eight bodies of work on the label before his exit in 2019. The label then had a 2.0 version that included <strong>MILLI, Ruby Gyang, Pryse, Victoria Kimani, Loose Kaynon </strong>and more. Then came the 3.0 version that had <strong>CKay, Koker </strong>and <strong>Dice Ailes. </strong>4.0 brought <strong>AQ, </strong>a reborn <strong>Loose Kaynon </strong>and <strong>Blaqbonez </strong>with their <strong>100 Crowns </strong>army.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-55>Coded Tunes</h2></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-39380c20-6277-4c5e-8780-4b13a10ddbb8 data-caption="ID Cabasa release 'Totori' featuring Olamide and Wizkid.

It was more like a collective of creatives - mostly rappers. That collective also house another collective called <strong>YabTown Squad </strong>- from which a certain <strong>Reminisce </strong>emanated. But still, <strong>Coded Tunes </strong>is credited with quality albums from <strong>Lord of Ajasa, 9ice </strong>and <strong>ID Cabasa </strong>himself.</p><p>As a producer, <strong>ID Cabasa </strong>is one of Nigeria’s greatest music producers ever. When <strong>2Phat </strong>and <strong>ID Cabasa </strong>turned <strong>Coded Tunes </strong>into a label, they signed <strong>Olamide, Kayefi </strong>and <strong>Seriki </strong>after <strong>9ice </strong>exited in acrimony for <strong>Alapomeji Records.</strong></p><p>Even though the label later tried to work with phenom, <strong>Kida Kudz, </strong>it never quite worked out and the label slowly disintegrated.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-63>MAVIN</h2></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Run: 2012 -</strong></p><p><strong>Estimated No. of albums: 10+</strong></p><p><strong>Notable artists: Tiwa Savage, Don Jazzy, Rema</strong></p><p><strong>MAVIN </strong>was the <strong>Don Jazzy </strong>part that survived the <strong>Mo’Hits </strong>collapse. Immediately, he signed <strong>Tiwa Savage </strong>and the group released a collaborative album. As this article is being written, <strong>MAVIN </strong>is Nigeria’s leading record label by brand equity and corporate influence.</p><p>The label also witnessed a more jovial and open <strong>Don Jazzy </strong>who had broken free of his <strong>DJ Tee</strong>-imposed ‘Don of little words’ persona. The hits came and so did the albums and controversy. <strong>MAVIN 2.0 </strong>brought <strong>Korede Bello, Reekado Banks, Di’Ja </strong>and more. The current <strong>MAVIN </strong>is home to <strong>Rema, Crayon </strong>and more.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6mrKyhk2S4prrNoqpmpaWotqR5zJqtoqZdmLWwr86lmK2dXZi2tcWMmqWdZaSdsm6z0Z6YrZ2jqXqvtcaeqaKZnmK%2Fpq%2FOq5tmpJGXsq2%2FjKygp5uVYoZ3e9hunJ2jZqk%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./love-and-weddings-what-next-in-a-relationship-if-she-says-no-to-a-marriage-proposal.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Love &amp;amp; Weddings What next in a relationship if she says no to a marriage proposal?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1496817-come-city-nigerians-gush-asake-debuts-lovely-dance-moves-shuts-concert-dallas.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Come to My City: Nigerians Gush As Asake Debuts Lovely Dance Moves As He Shuts Down Concert in Dalla</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2027-deputy-speaker-kalu-joins-call-for-gov-otti-to-join-apc.html>2027: Deputy Speaker, Kalu joins call for Gov Otti to join APC</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bruxelles-accorde-une-subvention-de-356-millions-deuros-aux-victimes-de-xynthia.html>Bruxelles accorde une subvention de 35,6 millions d'euros aux victimes de Xynthia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./prise-en-compte-de-la-penibilite-dans-la-fonction-publique-large-desaccord-entre-le-gouvernement-et.html>dsaccord sur les dparts anticips des fonctionnaires</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./events.html>Historical Events in April 1920</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1258549-nicole-kidman-bio-age-height-husband-children-net-worth-html.html>Nicole Kidman bio: age, height, husband, children, net worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVlog.
